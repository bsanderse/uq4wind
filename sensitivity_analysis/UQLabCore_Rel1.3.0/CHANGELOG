*New features*
- Input: 
  - Introduced new types of copulas 'CVine' and 'DVine'
  - Introduced possibility to specify inputs with independent sets of random variables
    (independent blocks) by specifying multiple copulas, one per block
  - Introduced statistical inference of marginals and of copulas
  - Introduced copula-based tests of pairwise and multivariate independence
    (Dr. E. Torre from ETH Zurich)

- Sensitivity analysis
  - New sample-based estimator for Kucherenko indices (provides compatibility with non-Gaussian copulas)
  - Borgonovo indices can now be computed from provided samples, no INPUT object required

  - The posterior covariance and correlation matrices are estimated from the MCMC sample
    by the uq_postProcessInversion function.

  - Gaussian process (GP) regression for noisy observed responses is now available
    (Dr. D. Wicaksono from ETH Zurich)

  - A collection of standard UQLab plotting and plot formatting functions
    is now consolidated in 'uq_graphics' inside the 'lib' folder
    (P. Wiederkehr, P.-R. Wagner, and Dr. D. Wicaksono from ETH Zurich)

    - Fixed problem in CV estimation with number of folds less than N
      (hold out batch was always reshuffle everytime the CV error function was called)

      in the Kriging predictor calculation (u0 matrix was not transposed prior to the call)
    - Nugget is now not added to the cross-correlation matrix
