%% Sensitivity analysis and calibration for ECN AeroModule

% In order to run the code, you need 
- UQLab and a license for UQLab. Set your UQLab path in config.m. Note that version 1.3 is provided standard with this repository (but not the license).
- ECN AeroModule and a license for it (contact Koen Boorsma at TNO). ECNAero.exe should exist on your path (set this in environment variables on WindowS)
