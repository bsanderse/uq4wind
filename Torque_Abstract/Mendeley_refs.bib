abstract = {Although uncertainties are present in all real parameters, numerical calculations of the structural behaviour of offshore wind turbines are usually conducted with deterministic values. However, with this approach, optimisation processes can be misleading and reliability levels cannot be calculated. The reasons for deterministic calculations are high computing times of probabilistic approaches and the lack of knowledge about the scatter of data. For deterministic approaches, more complex models with higher computing times are possible, although they, are less generally valid. Therefore, it is useful to identify the most influential parameters that have to be treated in a probabilistic manner using sensitivity analyses is valuable. Contrary to rudimentary sensitivity approaches being used in offshore wind energy so far, this paper presents a new four-step sensitivity analysis reducing the probabilistic parameter subset step by step and aiming to achieve a compromise between computing time and complexity. It can be shown that for different substructures and different load cases, only a small parameter subset is influential and many other inputs can be regarded as deterministic without losing accuracy. However, attention must be paid to the slight differences among substructures. Therefore, it must be highlighted that not all results are general.},

abstract = {Unsteady power output and long-term loads (extreme and fatigue) drive wind turbine design. However, these loads are difficult to include in optimization loops and are typically only assessed in a post-optimization load analysis or via reduced-order methods. Both alternatives yield suboptimal results. The reason for this difficulty lays in the deterministic approaches to long-term loads assessment. To model the statistics of lifetime loads they require the analysis of many unsteady load cases, generated from many different random seeds—a computationally expensive procedure. In this paper, we present an alternative: a stochastic solution for the unsteady aerodynamic loads based on a projection of the unsteady Blade Element Momentum (BEM) equations onto a stochastic space spanned by chaos exponentials. This approach is similar to the increasingly popular polynomial chaos expansion, but with 2 major differences. First, the BEM equations constitute a random process, varying in time, while previous polynomial chaos expansion methods were concerned with random parameters (ie, random but constant in time or initial values). Second, a new, more efficient basis (the exponential chaos) is used. This new stochastic method enables us to obtain unsteady long-term loads much faster, enabling unsteady loads to become accessible inside wind turbine optimization loops. In this paper we derive the stochastic BEM solution and present the most relevant results showing the accuracy of the new method.},

abstract = {The present paper characterizes the performance of non-intrusive uncertainty quantification methods for aeroservoelastic wind turbine analysis. Two different methods are considered, namely non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion and Kriging. Aleatory uncertainties are associated with the wind inflow characteristics and the blade surface state, on account of soiling and/or erosion, and propagated throughout the aeroservoelastic model of a large conceptual offshore wind turbine. Results are compared with a brute-force extensive Monte Carlo sampling, which is used as benchmark. Both methods require at least 1 order of magnitude less simulations than Monte Carlo, with a slight advantage of Kriging over polynomial chaos expansion. The analysis of the solution space clearly indicates the effects of uncertainties and their couplings, and highlights some possible shortcomings of current mostly deterministic approaches based on safety factors.},

abstract = {Vibrations of a wind turbine have a negative impact on its performance. Mitigating this undesirable impact requires knowledge of the relationship between the vibrations and other wind turbine parameters that could be potentially modified. Three approaches for ranking the impact importance of measurable turbine parameters on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower are discussed. They include the predictor importance analysis, the global sensitivity analysis, and the correlation coefficient analysis versed in data mining and statistics. To decouple the impact of wind speed on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower, the analysis is performed on data sets with narrow speed ranges. Wavelet analysis is applied to filter noisy accelerometer data. To exclude the impact malfunctions on the vibration analysis, the data are analyzed in a frequency domain. Data-mining algorithms are used to build models with turbine parameters of interest as inputs, and the vibrations of drive train and tower as outputs. The performance of each model is thoroughly evaluated based on metrics widely used in the wind industry. The neural network algorithm outperforms other classifiers and is considered to be the most promising approach to study wind turbine vibrations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

abstract = {The effects of wind shear and turbulence on rotor fatigue and loads control are explored for a large horizontal axis wind turbine in variable speed operation at wind speeds from 4 to 20 m/s. Two- and three-blade rigid rotors are considered over a range of wind shear exponents up to 1.25 and a range of turbulence intensities up to 17{\%}. RMS blade root flatwise moments are predicted to be very substantially increased at higher wind shear, and resultant fatigue damage is increased by many orders of magnitude. Smaller but similar trends occur with increasing turbulence levels. In-plane fatigue damage is driven by 1P gravity loads and exacerbated by turbulence level at higher wind speeds. This damage is higher by one to two orders of magnitude at the roots of the three-blade rotor compared with the two-blade rotor. Individual blade pitch control of fluctuating flatwise moments markedly reduces flatwise fatigue damage due to this source, and, to a lesser degree, the in-plane damage due to turbulence. The same is true of fluctuating rotor torque moments driven by turbulence and transmitted to the drive train. Blade root moments out of the plane of rotation aggregate to create rotor pitching and yawing moments transmitted to the turbine structure through the drive train to the yaw drive system and the tower. These moments are predicted to be relatively insensitive to turbulence level and essentially proportional to the wind shear exponent for the two-blade rotor. Fluctuating moments are substantially reduced with individual blade pitch control, and addition of a teeter degree-of-freedom should further contribute to this end. Fluctuating pitching and yawing moments of the three-blade rotor are substantially less sensitive to wind shear, more sensitive to turbulence level, and substantially lower than those for the two-blade rotor. Mean rotor torque and, hence, power are essentially the same for both rotors, independent of wind shear, and are somewhat reduced with individual blade pitch control of fluctuating flatwise moments. The same is true of mean rotor thrust; however fluctuations in rotor thrust are substantially reduced with individual blade pitch control.},

abstract = {According to the wind turbine standard IEC 61400-1, structural integrity of wind turbines is determined either by direct reference to wind data or by load calculation. In both cases, deterministic values are applied and uncertainties neglected for the wind climate parameters and the structural resistance.The uncertainty related to the wind climate parameters depends highly on the presence, duration and quality of on-site wind measurements, and the perturbations introduced by flow modelling. For the wind speed distribution, the uncertainty is considered in assessment of the annual energy production. For other wind climate parameters which potentially have a large influence on the wind turbine loads, the uncertainty is often not well investigated.This paper presents a probabilistic framework for assessment of the structural reliability level of wind turbines in fatigue loading. Uncertainty of the site specific wind climate parameters at each turbine position is estimated based on the local wind measurements, speed-up factors and the distance between the wind turbine and the measuring position. The framework is demonstrated for a wind turbine project in flat terrain. The results show that the uncertainty in the site specific wind climate parameters normally accounts for 10-30{\%} of the total uncertainty in the structural reliability analyses.},

abstract = {The paper describes the DAN-AERO MW experiments carried out within a collaborative, three years research project between Ris{\o} DTU and the industrial partners LM Glasfiber, Siemens Wind Power, Vestas Wind Systems and finally the utility company DONG Energy. The main objective of the project is to establish an experimental data base which can provide new insight into a number of fundamental aerodynamic and aeroacoustic issues, important for the design and operation of MW size turbines. The most important issue is the difference between airfoil characteristics measured under 2D, steady conditions in a wind tunnel and the unsteady 3D flow conditions on a rotor. The different transition characteristics might explain some of the difference between the 2D and 3D airfoil data and the experiments have been set up to provide data on this subject. The overall experimental approach has been to carry out a number of coordinated, innovative measurements on full scale MW size rotors as well as on airfoils for MW size turbines in wind tunnels. Shear and turbulence inflow characteristics were measured on a Siemens 3.6 MW turbine with a five hole pitot tube. Pressure and turbulent inflow characteristics were measured on a 2MW NM80 turbine with an 80 m rotor. One of the LM38.8 m blades on the rotor was replaced with a new LM38.8 m blade where instruments for surface pressure measurements at four radial sections were build into the blade during the blade production process. Additionally, the outmost section on the blade was further instrumented with around 60 microphones for high frequency surface pressure measurements. The surface pressure measurements have been correlated with inflow measurements from four five hole pitot tubes and two sensors for measuring the high frequency (50 Hz-10 kHz) contents of the inflow turbulence. In parallel, 2D wind tunnel measurements on common airfoils for wind turbine applications have been conducted in three different wind tunnels at Delft University (NL), at LM Glasfiber (DK) and at VELUX (DK). Initial results from the different measurement set-ups are presented in order to show the application areas for the total data set.

This reduces the number of design variables by an order of magnitude, and it provides much better control for surface shape changes. The proposed technique is simple, compact, and efficient.

abstract = {Currently, the wind turbine size is increasing dramatically, and the blades are experiencing large deformations. Accordingly, the aerodynamic force distributions over the blades are changed, and hence aeroelastic analysis has become of great importance. The state-of-the-art simulation tools for wind turbines aeroelasticity utilize engineering models to find the aeroelastic response. These tools use simplified methods such as BEM to find the unsteady aerodynamic loads and 1D structural models to determine the deformations. They are computationally cheap, but they are based on different corrections to account for the unsteadiness and the 3D effects. These corrections might lead to a decrease in model accuracy. Therefore, the objective of the present studies is to compare the results of engineering models to CFD-based aeroelastic simulations that do require less empirical modeling. The Multi-Body Simulation (MBS) solver SIMPACK is used to determine the dynamic response of the rotor and the blade aerodynamic loads were calculated by an integrated third-party module (AeroDyn) based on BEM. The block-structured CFD solver FLOWer is utilized to obtain the aerodynamic blade loads based on the time-accurate solution of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The engineering model predicted smaller power and thrust compared to the values obtained using the high-fidelity CFD-based aeroelastic model. Moreover, 1{\%}–1.5{\%} increase in the power and thrust was predicted from the engineering model by increasing the number of polars used along the blade.},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to calculate wind turbine load sensitivities to turbulence parameters through the use of response surfaces. A response surface is a highdimensional polynomial surface that can be calibrated to any set of input/output data and then used to generate synthetic data at a low computational cost. Sobol sensitivity indices (SIs) can then be calculated with relative ease using the calibrated response surface. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by calculating the total sensitivity of the maximum blade root bending moment of the WindPACT 5 MW reference model to four turbulence input parameters: a reference mean wind speed, a reference turbulence intensity, the Kaimal length scale, and a novel parameter reflecting the nonstationarity present in the inflow turbulence. The input/output data used to calibrate the response surface were generated for a previous project. The fit of the calibrated response surface is evaluated in terms of error between the model and the training data and in terms of the convergence. The Sobol SIs are calculated using the calibrated response surface, and the convergence is examined. The Sobol SIs reveal that, of the four turbulence parameters examined in this paper, the variance caused by the Kaimal length scale and nonstationarity parameter are negligible. Thus, the findings in this paper represent the first systematic evidence that stochastic wind turbine load response statistics can be modeled purely by mean wind wind speed and turbulence intensity.},

The wind turbine, support structure and environmental conditions are represented by a large number of input parameters, whose uncertainties are accounted by applying partial safety factors. In this paper, the sensitivity of fatigue loads with respect to primary structural, geotechnical and metocean parameters are investigated for a 5 MW offshore wind turbine installed on a gravity based foundation. Linear regression of Monte Carlo simulations and Morris screening are performed for three design load cases. Results show that parameter significance rankings vary according to which design load case is considered. In general, uncertainties in the fatigue loads are highly influenced by turbulence intensity and wave load uncertainties, while uncertainties in soil property suggest significant nonlinear or interactive effects. This work provides insights to foundation designers and wind turbine manufacturers on which parameters must be assessed in more detail in order to reduce uncertainties in load prediction.},

abstract = {Polynomial surrogates are used to characterize the energy production and lifetime equivalent fatigue loads for different components of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine under realistic atmospheric conditions. The variability caused by different turbulent inflow fields are captured by creating independent surrogates for the mean and standard deviation of each output with respect to the inflow realizations. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the turbulent inflow realization has a bigger impact on the total distribution of equivalent fatigue loads than the shear coefficient or yaw miss-alignment. The methodology presented extends the deterministic power and thrust coefficient curves to uncertainty models and adds new variables like damage equivalent fatigue loads in different components of the turbine. These surrogate models can then be implemented inside other work-flows such as: estimation of the uncertainty in annual energy production due to wind resource variability and/or robust wind power plant layout optimization. It can be concluded that it is possible to capture the global behavior of a modern wind turbine and its uncertainty under realistic inflow conditions using polynomial response surfaces. The surrogates are a way to obtain power and load estimation under site specific characteristics without sharing the proprietary aeroelastic design.},

In reference 1, a "fundamental" parametric airfoil geometry representation method was presented. The method included the introduction of a geometric "class function / shape function" transformation technique, CST, such that round nose / sharp aft end geometries as well as other classes of geometries could be represented exactly by analytic well behaved and simple mathematical functions having easily observed physical features. The CST method was shown to describe an essentially limitless design space composed entirely of analytically smooth geometries. In reference 2, the CST methodology was extended to more general three dimensional applications such as wing, body, ducts and nacelles. It was shown that any general 3D geometry can be represented by a distribution of fundamental shapes, and that the "shape function / class function" methodology can be used to describe the fundamental shapes as well as the distributions of the fundamental shapes. A number of applications of the "CST" method to nacelles, ducts, wings and bodies were presented to illustrate the versatility of this new methodology. In this paper, the CST method is extended to include geometric warping such as variable camber, simple flap, aeroelastic and flutter deflections. The use of the CST method for geometric morphing of one geometry to another is also shown. The use of CST analytic wings in design optimization will also be discussed.},

Due to the increased sensitivity of the considered system with respect to the environmental conditions from wind and ocean, the application of common procedures used for fixed-bottom structures results in either inaccurate simulation results or hard-to-quantify conservatism in the system design. Monte Carlo-based sampling procedures provide a more realistic approach to deal with the large variation in the environmental conditions, although basic randomization has shown slow convergence. Specialized sampling methods allow efficient coverage of the complete design space, resulting in faster convergence and hence a reduced number of required simulations. In this study, a quasi-random sampling approach based on Sobol sequences is applied to select representative events for the determination of the lifetime damage. This is calculated applying Monte Carlo integration, using subsets of a resulting total of 16{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}200 coupled time–domain simulations performed with the simulation code FAST.

In addition to that also a dynamic pitch step case is performed including a comparison to experimental data. The aerodynamic code used for this purpose allows to easily switch between BEM and vortex line models whilst keeping the external input the same. The comparison indicates that taking into account vortex wake models can yield a significantly different aero-elastic response compared to BEM models, often acting as a damper to fluctuations.

The loads analysis process requires precise knowledge of the expected wind-inflow conditions as well as turbine structural and aerodynamic properties. However, uncertainty in most parameters is inevitable. It is therefore important to understand the impact such uncertainties have on the resulting loads. The goal of this work is to assess which input parameters have the greatest influence on turbine power, fatigue loads, and ultimate loads during normal turbine operation. An Elementary Effects (EE) sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most sensitive parameters.

To cut the costs of DNS we consider a family of second-order, explicit one-leg time-integration methods and look for the method with the best linear stability properties.

Next, we discuss a fourth-order finite-volume method that is constructed as the Richardson extrapolate of a classical second-order method. We compare the results of this fourth-order method and the underlying second-order method for a DNS of the flow in a cubical driven cavity at Re = 104. Experimental results are available for comparison. For this example, the fourth-order results are clearly superior to the second-order results, whereas their computational effort is about twenty times less. With the improved simulation method, a DNS of a turbulent flow in a cubical lid-driven flow at Re = 50, 000 and a DNS of a turbulent flow past a square cylinder at Re = 22, 000 are performed.},

abstract = {Harlow and Welch [Phys. Fluids 8 (1965) 2182-2189] introduced a discretization method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations conserving the secondary quantities kinetic energy and vorticity, besides the primary quantities mass and momentum. This method was extended to fourth order accuracy by several researchers [25,14,21]. In this paper we propose a new consistent boundary treatment for this method, which is such that continuous integration-by-parts identities (including boundary contributions) are mimicked in a discrete sense. In this way kinetic energy is exactly conserved even in case of non-zero tangential boundary conditions. We show that requiring energy conservation at the boundary conflicts with order of accuracy conditions, and that the global accuracy of the fourth order method is limited to second order in the presence of boundaries. We indicate how non-uniform grids can be employed to obtain full fourth order accuracy.},

The two-fluid model is widely used in the oil and gas industry for dynamic multiphase pipeline simulations. The bubble drift velocity is an important quantity in predicting pipeline flushing and slug flow. In this paper, it is shown that the two-fluid model in its standard form predicts a bubble drift velocity of (Formula presented.) (similar to the shallow water equations), instead of the exact value of (Formula presented.) as derived by Benjamin [ 1 ] . Modifying the two-fluid model with the commonly employed momentum correction parameter leads to a steady solution (in a moving reference frame), but still predicts an erroneous bubble drift velocity. To get the correct bubble drift velocity, it is necessary to include the pressure variation along the channel height due to both the hydrostatic component and the vertical momentum flux.},

abstract = {For the purpose of uncertainty propagation a new quadrature rule technique is proposed that has positive weights, has high degree, and is constructed using only samples that describe the probability distribution of the uncertain parameters. Moreover, nodes can be added to the quadrature rule, resulting into a sequence of nested rules. The rule is constructed by iterating over the samples of the distribution and exploiting the null space of the Vandermonde-system that describes the nodes and weights, in order to select which samples will be used as nodes in the quadrature rule. The main novelty of the quadrature rule is that it can be constructed using any number of dimensions, using any basis, in any space, and using any distribution. It is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically that the rule always has positive weights and therefore has high convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. The convergence properties are demonstrated by approximating the integral of the Genz test functions. The applicability of the quadrature rule to complex uncertainty propagation cases is demonstrated by determining the statistics of the flow over an airfoil governed by the Euler equations, including the case of dependent uncertain input parameters. The new quadrature rule significantly outperforms classical sparse grid methods.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 One-dimensional models for multiphase flow in pipelines are commonly discretised using first-order Finite Volume (FV) schemes, often combined with implicit time-integration methods. While robust, these methods introduce much numerical diffusion depending on the number of grid points. In this paper we propose a high-order, space-time Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element method with h-adaptivity to improve the efficiency of one-dimensional multiphase flow simulations. For smooth initial boundary value problems we show that the DG method converges with the theoretical rate and that the growth rate and phase shift of small, harmonic perturbations exhibit superconvergence. We employ two techniques to accurately and efficiently represent discontinuities. Firstly artificial diffusion in the neighbourhood of a discontinuity suppresses spurious oscillations. Secondly local mesh refinement allows for a sharper representation of the discontinuity while keeping the amount of work required to obtain a solution relatively low. The proposed DG method is shown to be superior to FV.},

abstract = {An efficient algorithm is proposed for Bayesian model calibration, which is commonly used to estimate the model parameters of non-linear, computationally expensive models using measurement data. The approach is based on Bayesian statistics: using a prior distribution and a likelihood, the posterior distribution is obtained through application of Bayes' law. Our novel algorithm to accurately determine this posterior requires significant fewer discrete model evaluations than traditional Monte Carlo methods. The key idea is to replace the expensive model by an interpolating surrogate model and to construct the interpolating nodal set maximizing the accuracy of the posterior. To determine such a nodal set an extension to weighted Leja nodes is introduced, based on a new weighting function. We prove that the convergence of the posterior has the same rate as the convergence of the model. If the convergence of the posterior is measured in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the rate doubles. The algorithm and its theoretical properties are verified in three different test cases: analytical cases that confirm the correctness of the theoretical findings, Burgers' equation to show its applicability in implicit problems, and finally the calibration of the closure parameters of a turbulence model to show the effectiveness for computationally expensive problems.},

abstract = {A building block strategy for modelling the pressure loss coefficient of flow through a complex geometry is presented. The approach relies on decomposing a complex flow geometry into geometrical building blocks of which the pressure loss coefficients are characterized individually. The different contributions are subsequently combined to describe the pressure loss of the geometry as a whole. This approach is applied and tested to an industrially relevant application: a by-pass pig (Pipeline Inspection Gauge). This is a cylindrical device that travels inside a pipeline and is commonly used in the oil and gas industry for pipeline maintenance. An important factor in determining the ultimate velocity of the device is the pressure drop over the by-pass pig, which is characterized by a pressure loss coefficient due to the by-passing fluids. In this study the pressure loss coefficient of three frequently used by-pass pig geometries in a single phase pipeline is investigated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The CFD results are used to validate the simple building block approach for systematic modelling of the pressure loss through the by-pass pigs, which takes the geometry and size of the by-pass opening into account. It is shown that the pressure loss models can capture the CFD results for each of the three pig geometries. The pressure loss models can be combined with pig/pipe-wall friction models to predict the velocity of a by-pass pig in a single phase pipeline, which is important for a safe and effective pigging operation. The applied building block approach may also be suitable to characterize pressure loss coefficients of complex geometries in general.},

Our approach overcomes the limitation of many traditional methods, such as generalised polynomial chaos methods, which may lack sufficient accuracy when the quantity of interest depends discontinuously on the input parameters. As a remedy we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm based on minimum spanning trees combined with a domain decomposition method based on support vector machines. The minimum spanning tree determines new sample locations based on both the probability density of the input parameters and the gradient in the quantity of interest. The support vector machine efficiently decomposes the random space in multiple elements, avoiding the appearance of Gibbs phenomena near discontinuities. On each element, local approximations are constructed by means of least orthogonal interpolation, in order to produce stable interpolation on the unstructured sample set. The resulting minimum spanning tree multi-element method does not require initial knowledge of the behaviour of the quantity of interest and automatically detects whether discontinuities are present. We present several numerical examples that demonstrate accuracy, efficiency and generality of the method.},

abstract = {This report has two main goals. First, it numerically investigates three velocity-pressure reduced order models (ROMs) for incompressible flows. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to generate the modes. One method computes the ROM pressure solely based on the velocity POD modes, whereas the other two ROMs use pressure modes as well. To the best of the authors' knowledge, one of the latter methods is novel. The second goal is to numerically investigate the impact of the snapshot accuracy on the results of the ROMs. Numerical studies are performed on a two-dimensional laminar flow past a circular obstacle. Comparing the results of the ROMs and of the simulations for computing the snapshots, it turns out that the latter results are generally well reproduced by the ROMs. This observation is made for snapshots of different accuracy. Both in terms of reproducing the results of the underlying simulations for obtaining the snapshots and of efficiency, the two ROMs that utilize pressure modes are superior to the ROM that uses only velocity modes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The two essential elements to non-linear stability are: (1) first discretise the full order model, and then project the discretised equations, and (2) use spatial and temporal discretisation schemes that are globally energy-conserving (in the limit of vanishing viscosity). For this purpose, as full order model a staggered-grid finite volume method in conjunction with an implicit Runge-Kutta method is employed. In addition, a new constrained singular value decomposition is proposed which enforces global momentum conservation. The resulting ROM is thus globally conserving mass, momentum and kinetic energy. For non-homogeneous boundary conditions, a (one-time) Poisson equation is solved that accounts for the boundary contribution. The stability of the proposed ROM is demonstrated in several test cases.},

Analyzing the Riemann problem structure, local constants appear precisely at locations where the non-conservative products need definition.

The study is limited to the case when small timescale relaxation terms can be neglected, and therefore, a two-pressure model can be reduced to an equivalent volume- average, one-pressure model. The primary focus of the work is to consider flow with compressible components and to compare hyperbolicity criteria with the results of commonly used limitations of flow with incompressible phases. Based on a review of current achievements in this area, a generic form of momentum conservation equations that are invariant from the definition of differential interfacial terms is suggested. New analytical criteria of strict hyperbolicity of the governing system for the compressible two-phase-flow model are developed and supported by numerical calculations and comparisons. Furthermore, overrestric- tion of results of eigenvalue analysis based on an incompressible components model is demonstrated. The derived criteria are applied to RELAP5-3D in the form of modifications to momentum equations. Upon implementing the developed criteria, the simulation results show marked improvement in stability without otherwise affecting the calculations. The importance of well-posedness of the initial value problem for numerical solution stability is demonstrated.},

abstract = {This paper puts forth two new closure models for the proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order modeling of structurally dominated turbulent flows: the dynamic subgrid-scale model and the variational multiscale model. These models, which are considered state-of-the-art in large eddy simulation, together with the mixing length and the Smagorinsky closure models, are tested in the numerical simulation of 3D turbulent flow past a circular cylinder at Re= 1000. Five criteria are used to judge the performance of the proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order models: the kinetic energy spectrum, the mean velocity, the Reynolds stresses, the root mean square values of the velocity fluctuations, and the time evolution of the POD coefficients. All the numerical results are benchmarked against a direct numerical simulation. Based on these numerical results, we conclude that the dynamic subgrid-scale and the variational multiscale models are the most accurate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

On the contrary to what is normally done in the framework of finite element reduced order methods, different geometries are not mapped to a common referenced domain: the method relies on a modified set of basis functions and makes use of the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (D-EIM) to handle together non-affinity of the parametrization and non-linearities. Different mesh motion strategies, based on a Laplacian smoothing technique and on a Radial Basis Function approach, are analyzed and compared.

abstract = {Numerical simulation of fluid flows requires important computational efforts but it is essential in engineering applications. Reduced Order Model (ROM) can be employed whenever fast simulations are required, or in general, whenever a trade-off between computational cost and solution accuracy is a preeminent issue as in process optimization and control. In this work, the efforts have been put to develop a ROM for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) application based on Finite Volume approximation, starting from the results available in turbulent Reynold-Averaged Navier–Stokes simulations in order to enlarge the application field of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Reduced Order Model (POD-ROM) technique to more industrial fields. The approach is tested in the classic benchmark of the numerical simulation of the 2D lid-driven cavity. In particular, two simulations at Re=103 and Re=105 have been considered in order to assess both a laminar and a turbulent case. Some quantities have been compared with the Full Order Model in order to assess the performance of the proposed ROM procedure i.e., the kinetic energy of the system and the reconstructed quantities of interest (velocity, pressure and turbulent viscosity). In addition, for the laminar case, the comparison between the ROM steady-state solution and the data available in literature has been presented. The results have turned out to be very satisfactory both for the accuracy and the computational times. As a major outcome, the approach turns out not to be affected by the energy blow up issue characterizing the results obtained by classic turbulent POD-Galerkin methods.},

abstract = {A novel method is proposed to infer Bayesian predictions of computationally expensive models. The method is based on the construction of quadrature rules, which are well-suited for approximating the weighted integrals occurring in Bayesian prediction. The novel idea is to construct a sequence of nested quadrature rules with positive weights that converge to a quadrature rule that is weighted with respect to the posterior. The quadrature rules are constructed using a proposal distribution that is determined by means of nearest neighbor interpolation of all available evaluations of the posterior. It is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically that this approach yields accurate estimates of the integrals involved in Bayesian prediction. The applicability of the approach for a fluid dynamics test case is demonstrated by inferring accurate predictions of the transonic flow over the RAE2822 airfoil with a small number of model evaluations. Here, the closure coefficients of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model are considered to be uncertain and are calibrated using wind tunnel measurements.},

abstract = {A novel approach is proposed to reduce, compared to the conventional binning approach, the large number of aeroelastic code evaluations that are necessary to obtain equivalent loads acting on wind turbines. These loads describe the effect of long-term environmental variability on the fatigue loads of a horizontal-axis wind turbine. In particular Design Load Case 1.2, as standardized by IEC, is considered. The approach is based on numerical integration techniques and, more specifically, quadrature rules. The quadrature rule used in this work is a recently proposed "implicit" quadrature rule, which has the main advantage that it can be constructed directly using measurements of the environment. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach yields accurate estimations of the equivalent loads using a significantly reduced number of aeroelastic model evaluations (compared to binning). Moreover the error introduced by the seeds (introduced by averaging over random wind fields and sea states) is incorporated in the quadrature framework, yielding an even further reduction in the number of aeroelastic code evaluations. The reduction in computational time is demonstrated by assessing the fatigue loads on the NREL 5MW reference offshore wind turbine in conjunction with measurement data obtained at the North Sea, both for a simplified and a full load case.},

To implement these physical constraints, in the data-driven modeling step of the DDF-ROM, we replace the unconstrained least squares problem with a constrained least squares problem.

Current existing main nuclear thermal-hydraulics (T-H) system analysis codes, such as RALAP5, TRACE, and CATHARE, play a crucial role in the nuclear engineering field for the design and safety analysis of nuclear reactor systems. However, two-fluid model used in these T-H system analysis codes is ill posed, easily leading to numerical oscillations, and the classical first-order methods for temporal and special discretization are widely employed for numerical simulations, yielding excessive numerical diffusion. Two-fluid seven-equation two-pressure model is of particular interest due to the inherent well-posed advantage. Moreover, high-order accuracy schemes have also attracted great attention to overcome the challenge of serious numerical diffusion induced by low-order time and space schemes for accurately simulating nuclear T-H problems. In this paper, the semi-implicit solution algorithm with high-order accuracy in space and time is developed for this well-posed two-fluid model and the robustness and accuracy are verified and assessed against several important two-phase flow benchmark tests in the nuclear engineering T-H field, which include two linear advection problems, the oscillation problem of the liquid column, the Ransom water faucet problem, the reversed water faucet problem, and the two-phase shock tube problem. The following conclusions are achieved. (1) The proposed semi-implicit solution algorithm is robust in solving two-phase flows, even for fast transients and discontinuous solutions. (2) High-order schemes in both time and space could prevent excessive numerical diffusion effectively and the numerical simulation results are more accurate than those of first-order time and space schemes, which demonstrates the advantage of using high-order schemes.},

Slug statistical characteristics can be numerically predicted with results in good agreement with experimental data and well-known empirical relations. In this model some approximated and simplified assumptions are adopted to describe shear stresses at wall and at phase interface. In this paper, we focus on the possibility to account for the cross sectional flow by inserting shape factors into the momentum balance equations of the aforementioned model. Velocity profiles are obtained by a pre-integrated model and they are computed at each time step and at each computational cell. Once that the velocity profiles are known, the obtained shape factors are inserted in the numerical resolution. In this way it is possible to recover part of the information lost due to the one-dimensional flow description. Velocity profiles computed in stratified conditions are compared against experimental profiles measured by PIV technique; a method to compute the velocity profile during slug initiation and growth has been developed and the computed velocity distribution in the liquid phase was compared against the one-seventh power law.},

In this study, we develop an estimation method that quantifies the discretization error based on data. The key idea is to model the discretization error as random variables and estimate their variance simultaneously with the ODE parameter. The proposed method has the form of iteratively reweighted least squares, where the discretization error variance is updated with the isotonic regression algorithm and the ODE parameter is updated by solving a weighted least squares problem using the adjoint system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves estimation accuracy by accounting for the discretization error in a data-driven manner.},

abstract = {In order to compute an integral I[f], one needs at least two cubature formulae Qj, j∈{\{}1, 2{\}}. |Q1[f]-Q2[f]| can be used as an error estimate for the less precise cubature formula. In order to reduce the amount of work, one can try to reuse some of the function evaluations needed for Q1, in Q2. The easiest way to construct embedded cubature formulae is: start with a high degree formula Q1, drop (at least) one knot and calculate the weights such that the new formula Q2 is exact for as much monomials as possible. We describe how such embedded formulae with positive weights can be found. The disadvantage of such embedded cubature formulae is that there is in general a large difference in the degree of exactness of the two formulae. In this paper we will explain how the high degree formula can be chosen to obtain an embedded pair of cubature formulae of degrees 2 m+1/2 m-1. The method works for all regions $\Omega$⊂ℝn, n≧2. We will also show the influence of structure on the cubature formulae. {\textcopyright} 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. In simulation of cardiovascular processes and diseases patient-specific model parameters, such as constitutive properties, are usually not easy to obtain. Instead of using population mean values to perform “patient-specific” simulations, thereby neglecting the inter- and intra-patient variations present in these parameters, these uncertainties have to be considered in the computational assessment. However, due to limited computational resources and several shortcomings of traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, parametric uncertainties, modeled as random fields, have not yet been considered in patient-specific, nonlinear, large-scale, and complex biomechanical applications. Hence, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, we present an uncertainty quantification framework based on multi-fidelity sampling and Bayesian formulations. The key feature of the presented method is the ability to rigorously exploit and incorporate information from an approximate, low fidelity model. Most importantly, response statistics of the corresponding high fidelity model can be computed accurately even if the low fidelity model provides only a very poor approximation. The approach merely requires that the low fidelity model and the corresponding high fidelity model share a similar stochastic structure, i.e., dependence on the random input. This results in a tremendous flexibility in choice of the approximate model. The flexibility and capabilities of the framework are demonstrated by performing uncertainty quantification using two patient-specific, large-scale, nonlinear finite element models of abdominal aortic aneurysms. One constitutive parameter of the aneurysmatic arterial wall is modeled as a univariate three-dimensional, non-Gaussian random field, thereby taking into account inter-patient as well as intra-patient variations of this parameter. We use direct Monte Carlo to evaluate the proposed method and found excellent agreement with this reference solution. Additionally, the employed approach results in a tremendous reduction of computational costs, rendering uncertainty quantification with complex patient-specific nonlinear biomechanical models practical for the first time. Second, we also analyze the impact of the uncertainty in the input parameter on mechanical quantities typically related to abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture potential such as von Mises stress, von Mises strain and strain energy. Thus, providing first estimates on the variability of these mechanical quantities due to an uncertain constitutive parameter, and revealing the potential error made by assuming population averaged mean values in patient-specific simulations of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Moreover, the influence of correlation length of the random field is investigated in a parameter study using MC.},

Such constraints are usually imposed as soft constraints by adding new terms to the loss function that is minimized during training. An alternative is to impose them as hard constraints, which has a number of theoretical benefits but has not been explored so far due to the perceived intractability of the problem. In this paper, we show that imposing hard constraints can in fact be done in a computationally feasible way and delivers reasonable results. However, the theoretical benefits do not materialize and the resulting technique is no better than existing ones relying on soft constraints. We analyze the reasons for this and hope to spur other researchers into proposing better solutions.},

For the single-phase Poiseuille flow driven by the uniform force, the coarse solution was obtained with the zero-order deconvolution.

@article{Tartakovsky2011a,
abstract = {Many natural physical processes allow different mathematical descriptions on different scales. The microscale description is usually based on fundamental conservation laws that form a closed system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs) but the numerical discretization of these equations may produce a system of ODEs with an enormous number of unknowns. Furthermore, time integration of the microscale equations usually requires time steps that are smaller than the observation time by many orders of magnitude. A direct solution of these ODEs can be extremely expensive. Often, we are only interested in the average behavior of the microscale system rather than the exact solution of the ODEs. Here we propose a novel dimension reduction computational closure (DRNC) method that gives an approximate solution of the ODEs and provides an accurate prediction of the average behavior. The DRNC method consists of two main elements. First, effective ODEs for evolution of average variables (e.g. average velocity, concentration and mass of a mineral precipitate) are obtained by averaging the micro-scale ODEs over the entire micro-scale domain. These effective ODEs contain non-local terms in the form of volume integrals of functions of the micro-scale variables. Second, a numerical closure is used to close the system of the effective equations. The numerical closure is achieved via short bursts of the microscale model. The DRNC method is used to simulate flow and transport with mixing controlled reactions and mineral precipitation by reducing porescale (microscale) Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion-reaction equations to ODEs for averaged velocity and concentrations. Good agreement between direct solutions of the microscale equations and DRNC solutions for different boundary conditions and Damkohler numbers confirms the accuracy and computational efficiency of DRNC method. The DRNC method significantly accelerates microscale simulations, while providing accurate approximation of the microscale solution and accurate prediction of the average behavior of the system. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

With this approach an approximation of the unfiltered solution is obtained by repeated filtering. Given a good approximation of the unfiltered solution, the nonlinear terms of the filtered Navier-Stokes equations can be computed directly. The effect of nonrepresented scales is modeled by a relaxation regularization involving a secondary filter operation. Large-eddy simulations are performed for incompressible channel flow at Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half-width of Re T = 180 and Re T = 590. Both simulations compare well with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data and show a significant improvement over results obtained with classical subgrid scale models such as the standard or the dynamic Smagorinsky model.

First, a theoretical study of discrete filters in physical space is performed. The analysis is done in the uniform one-dimensional case, and is then extended to the general multi-dimensional case for arbitrary structured and unstructured meshes. Some equivalence classes for the discrete filters are defined, based either on a differential approximation or the associated transfer function. Methods for the definition of discrete filters are proposed in the general case, including the approximation of continuous convolution filters. Second, the sensitivity of several SGS models with respect to the test filter is investigated. The selected models are: the dynamic Smagorinsky model, the mixed scale model (MSM), the selective MSM and the Liu-Meneveau-Katz (LMK) similarity model. Improved versions, which explicitly account for the spectral width of the test filter of the MSM and the LMK similarity model are proposed. The analysis, which reveals a significant influence of the test filter, is done through a priori testing on a 1283 field issued from the large eddy simulation (LES) of freely decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence.},

The resulting system of Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations are integrated in time by the energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The mass and energy preserving reduced order model (ROM) is constructed by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) Galerkin projection. The nonlinearities are computed for the ROM efficiently by discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Preservation of the semi-discrete energy and mass are shown for the full order model (FOM) and for the ROM which ensures the long term stability of the solutions. Numerical simulations illustrate the preservation of the energy and mass in the reduced order model for the two dimensional NLSE with and without the external potential.

The proposed refinement measure is suited for efficient parametric surrogate construction when the underlying PDE is known, even when the parameter space is non-hypercube, and has no restrictions on the type of the discretisation method.

However, in their traditional form, such models require a large amount of training data. This is of particular importance for various engineering and scientific applications where data may be extremely expensive to obtain. To overcome this shortcoming, physics-constrained deep learning provides a promising methodology as it only utilizes the governing equations. In this work, we propose a novel auto-regressive dense encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to solve and model transient systems with non-linear dynamics at a computational cost that is potentially magnitudes lower than standard numerical solvers. This model includes a Bayesian framework that allows for uncertainty quantification of the predicted quantities of interest at each time-step. We rigorously test this model on several non-linear transient partial differential equation systems including the turbulence of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, multi-shock formation and interaction with 1D Burgers' equation and 2D wave dynamics with coupled Burgers' equations. For each system, the predictive results and uncertainty are presented and discussed together with comparisons to the results obtained from traditional numerical analysis methods.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation into the finite-dimensional algebraic system solved by computers. Due to complicated nature of the physics and geometry, such process can be computational prohibitive for most real-time applications and many-query analyses. Therefore, developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance. Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality. However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures fail to operate when the data becomes sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g., Naiver--Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions, and the governing partial differential equations are incorporated into the loss of the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle numerical simulations.},

abstract = {By deconvolution we mean the solution of a linear first-kind integral equation with a convolution-type kernel, i.e., a kernel that depends only on the difference between the two independent variables. Deconvolution problems are special cases of linear first-kind Fredholm integral equations, whose treatment requires the use of regularization methods. The corresponding computational problem takes the form of structured matrix problem with a Toeplitz or block Toeplitz coefficient matrix. The aim of this paper is to present a tutorial survey of numerical algorithms for the practical treatment of these discretized deconvolution problems, with emphasis on methods that take the special structure of the matrix into account. Wherever possible, analogies to classical DFT-based deconvolution problems are drawn. Among other things, we present direct methods for regularization with Toeplitz matrices, and we show how Toeplitz matrixvector products are computed by means of FFT, being useful in iterative methods. We also introduce the Kronecker product and show how it is used in the discretization and solution of 2-D deconvolution problems whose variables separate.},

The success of transport based distances is in part due to their Lagrangian nature which allows it to capture the important variations in many signal classes. However these distances require the signal to be nonnegative and normalized. Furthermore, the signals are considered as measures and compared by redistributing (transporting) them, which does not directly take into account the signal intensity. Here we study a transport-based distance, called the {\$}TL{\^{}}p{\$} distance, that combines Lagrangian and intensity modelling and is directly applicable to general, non-positive and multi-channelled signals. The framework allows the application of existing numerical methods. We give an overview of the basic properties of this distance and applications to classification, with multi-channelled, non-positive one and two-dimensional signals, and color transfer.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of negative frictional pressure drop could occur in vertical two-phase flow in some conditions. At gas-liquid ratios ranging from 100 to 10,000, the two-phase flow in a liquid-loading gas well was experimentally simulated in a vertical pipe. The superficial gas velocities range from 0.1. m/s to 20. m/s and the superficial liquid velocities range from 0.00001. m/s to 0.2. m/s corresponding to the gas-liquid ratios. The negative frictional pressure drop was observed in this experiment. The uncertainty analysis shows that the negative frictional pressure drop could not be undoubtedly attributed to measurement error. Further investigation indicates that the energy loss is associated with a buoyancy-like term in addition to the frictional pressure drop in vertical two-phase flow. By taking this buoyancy-like term into account, the energy losses obtained from experimental data are all positive in the cases of negative frictional pressure drops. The results demonstrate the potential for the negative frictional pressure drop in which case the energy loss is positive and hence the rule of energy conversion is not violated in vertical two-phase flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Large eddy simulation (LES) has been increasingly used to tackle vortex-dominated turbulent flows. In LES, the quality of the simulation results hinges upon the quality of the numerical discretizations in both space and time. It is in this context we perform a Fourier analysis of several popular methods in LES including the discontinuous Galerkin (DG), finite difference (FD), and compact difference (CD) methods. We begin by reviewing the semi-discrete versions of all methods under consideration, followed by a fully-discrete analysis with explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) time integration schemes. In this regard, we are able to unravel the true dispersion/dissipation behavior of DG and Runge–Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes for the entire wavenumber range using a combined-mode analysis. In this approach, we take into account all eigenmodes in DG and RKDG schemes. The physical-mode is verified to be a good approximation for the asymptotic behavior of these DG schemes in the low wavenumber range. After that, we proceed to compare the DG, FD, and CD methods in dispersion and dissipation properties. Numerical tests are conducted using the linear advection equation to verify the analysis. In comparing different methods, it is found that the overall numerical dissipation strongly depends on the time step. Compact difference (CD) and central FD schemes, in some particular settings, can have more numerical dissipation than the DG scheme with an upwind flux. This claim is then verified through a numerical test using the Burgers' equation.},

@article{Yang2018,
abstract = {We present an energy-stable scheme for numerically approximating the governing equations for incompressible two-phase flows with different densities and dynamic viscosities for the two fluids. The proposed scheme employs a scalar-valued auxiliary energy variable in its formulation, and it satisfies a discrete energy stability property. More importantly, the scheme is computationally efficient. Within each time step, it computes two copies of the flow variables (velocity, pressure, phase field function) by solving individually a linear algebraic system involving a constant and time-independent coefficient matrix for each of these field variables. The coefficient matrices involved in these linear systems only need to be computed once and can be pre-computed. Additionally, within each time step the scheme requires the solution of a nonlinear algebraic equation about a {\{}$\backslash$em scalar-valued number{\}} using the Newton's method. The cost for this nonlinear solver is very low, accounting for only a few percent of the total computation time per time step, because this nonlinear equation is about a scalar number, not a field function. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for several two-phase flow problems involving large density ratios and large viscosity ratios. Comparisons with theory show that the proposed method produces physically accurate results. Simulations with large time step sizes demonstrate the stability of computations and verify the robustness of the proposed method. An implication of this work is that energy-stable schemes for two-phase problems can also become computationally efficient and competitive, eliminating the need for expensive re-computations of coefficient matrices, even at large density ratios and viscosity ratios.},

The discretization is built on a three-dimensional, unstructured finite-volume framework and aims at minimizing the differences in kinetic energy preservation with respect to the continuous governing equations. This property plays a fundamental role in the case of flows presenting significant levels of turbulence. At the same time, the hybrid form of the convective operator proposed in this work incorporates localized low-dispersion characteristics to limit the growth of spurious flow solutions. The low-dissipation discrete framework is presented in detail and, in order to expose the advantages with respect to commonly used methodologies, its conservation properties and accuracy are extensively studied, both theoretically and numerically. Numerical tests are performed by considering a three-dimensional vortex, an exact sinusoidal function, and a spherical drop subjected to surface tension forces in equilibrium and immersed in a swirling velocity field. Finally, the turbulent atomization of a liquid-gas jet is numerically analyzed to further assess the capabilities of the method.},

Our theory includes not only discrete differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits both vector fields and forms.},

abstract = {2018 marked the 80th anniversary of Lanczos (1938) and 2017 was the 50th anniversary of Villadsen and Stewart (1967), both seminal works in development of the Orthogonal Collocation Method, also known as the Pseudospectral Method and Differential Quadrature Method. Due to these milestones, a retrospective on development of the method seems appropriate. The method's development as a Method of Weighted Residuals (MWR), with numerical integration, is reviewed. It is placed into historical perspective and developments in disparate disciplines are reconciled. We show the equivalence of methods that were thought by many to be different. Guidance in navigating the minefield of terminology is also provided. In addition to reviewing the development of the method, we show some refinements which are not known to most practitioners. Chief amongst these are the correct treatment of boundary conditions involving fluxes. We demonstrate that a proper treatment of flux boundary conditions can sometimes reduce errors by several orders of magnitude.},

Current and future applications have epic proportion: cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, wind turbines, medical devices, combustion, chemical reactors, just to name a few. Methods to adaptively adjust open-loop parameters are continually improving toward shorter response times. However, control design for in-time response is challenged by strong nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and time-delays. Recent advances in the field of model identification and system reduction, coupled with advances in control theory (robust, adaptive, and nonlinear) are driving significant progress in adaptive and in-time closed-loop control of fluid turbulence. In this review, we provide an overview of critical theoretical developments, highlighted by compelling experimental success stories. We also point to challenging open problems and propose potentially disruptive technologies of machine learning and compressive sensing.},

abstract = {A novel mathematical framework is derived for the addition of nodes to interpolatory quadrature rules. The framework is based on the geometrical interpretation of the Vandermonde-matrix describing the relation between the nodes and the weights and can be used to determine all nodes that can be added to an interpolatory quadrature rule with positive weights such that the positive weights are preserved. In the case of addition of a single node, the derived inequalities that describe the regions where nodes can be added or replaced are explicit. It is shown that, depending on the location of existing nodes and moments of the distribution, addition of a single node and preservation of positive weights is not always possible. On the other hand, addition of multiple nodes and preservation of positive weights is always possible, although the minimum number of nodes that need to be added can be as large as the number of nodes of the quadrature rule. Moreover, in this case the inequalities describing the regions where nodes can be added become implicit. An algorithm is presented to explore these regions and it is shown that the well-known Patterson extension of quadrature rules forms the boundary of these regions. Two new quadrature rules, based on the framework, are proposed and their efficiency is numerically demonstrated by using Genz test functions.},

abstract = {We analyze the large-eddy equations that are obtained from the application of a spatially nonuniform filter to the Navier-Stokes equations. Next to the well-known turbulent stress tensor a second group of subgrid terms arises; the so-called commutator errors. These additional subgrid terms emerge in the large-eddy equations solely as a consequence of the nonuniformity of the filter. We compare the magnitude of the divergence of the turbulent stress tensor with that of the commutator errors and pay attention to the role of the explicit filter that is adopted. It is shown that the turbulent stress contributions and the commutator errors display the same scaling behavior on the filter width and its derivative. Correspondingly, the use of higher-order filters is shown not only to decrease the commutator errors but likewise the turbulent stresses are uniformly reduced with increasing filter order. In addition, we establish that skewness of the spatial filter has a strong influence on the magnitude of the commutator errors while leaving the turbulent stress contributions roughly unaltered. The analysis of the order of magnitude of the various terms provides an impression of the flow conditions and filter width nonuniformities which necessitate explicit commutator-error modeling next to the more traditional turbulent stress subgrid modeling. Some explicit models for the commutator errors are put forward and an a priori assessment of these commutator-error models in turbulent mixing layers is obtained. Generalized similarity models appear promising in this respect and display high correlation with the exact commutator errors. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent flows, there is a current need to compare and evaluate different proposed subfilter-scale models. In order to carefully compare subfilter-scale models and compare LES predictions to Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results (the latter would be helpful in the comparison and validation of models), there is a real need for a "grid-independent" LES capability and explicit filtering methods offer one means by which this may be achieved. Advantages of explicit filtering are that it provides a means for eliminating aliasing errors, allows for the direct control of commutation errors, and most importantly allows a decoupling between the mesh spacing and the filter width which is the primary reason why there are difficulties in comparing LES solutions obtained on different grids. This thesis considers the design and assessment of discrete explicit filters and their application to isotropic turbulence prediction. ii},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Lund1997,
abstract = {1. Motivation and objectives The equations for large eddy simulation (LES) are derived formally by applying a l o w pass--lter to the Navier-Stokes equations. This sltering must be repeated at each time step in the solution procedure since the non-linear terms continually generate frequencies higher than the assumed cutoo. In spite of this requirement, an explicit tltering operation has rarely been performed in practice. There are a few good reasons for this discrepancy, and perhaps the most compelling of these is the prior lack of flter operators that commute with diierentiation. Without com-muting operators, the act of fltering alters the Navier-Stokes equations through the addition of 'commutation error terms' (see Ghosal and Moin, 1995). Fortunately the commutation issue has recently been resolved by V asilyev and Lund (this volume) who constructed dlters that commute with diierentiation to any speciied order of accuracy for arbitrary boundary conditions. The use of explicit tlters opens the possibility to improve the edelity and con-sistency of the LES procedure. By removing (or strongly damping) a band of the highest frequencies allowed by the mesh, it is possible to reduce truncation and aliasing errors. The elter is also well deened, which facilitates a comparison with ((ltered) experimental data. In order to realize these beneets, however, the eltering process must be implemented correctly, and the elter itself should have satissed a few constraints in addition to those required by commutation. The purpose of this paper is to outline the general procedure for explicit tltering and to specify the constraints on the elter shape. A second objective of this paper is to revisit some of the issues related to oltering in the dynamic model calculation and to propose a general method of estimating the test tlter width.},

Fluids 13 (6) (2001) 1800-1806], we present a VMS formulation which can be used in the simulation of compressible flows. Special attention is given to obtain a VMS formulation which is suitable for complex flow domains and general variational discretization techniques. A generalization of the Favre-averaging procedure is introduced such that the formulation resembles the Favre-filtered Navier-Stokes equations traditionally used in LES of compressible flow, and no explicit subgrid terms arise in the continuity equation. Also, we show that with the use of discretization methods other than Fourier-spectral methods the VMS-projection no longer commutes with differentiation. This results in additional subgrid scale terms which resemble the commutator error as encountered in the traditional filtering approach to LES. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

                  {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}The simulation of turbulent flows by means of computational fluid dynamics is highly challenging. The costs of an accurate direct numerical simulation (DNS) are usually too high, and engineers typically resort to cheaper coarse-grained models of the flow, such as large-eddy simulation (LES). To be suitable for the computation of turbulence, methods should not numerically dissipate the turbulent flow structures. Therefore, energy-conserving discretizations are investigated, which do not dissipate energy and are inherently stable because the discrete convective terms cannot spuriously generate kinetic energy. They have been known for incompressible flow, but the development of such methods for compressible flow is more recent. This paper will focus on the latter: LES and DNS for turbulent subsonic flow. A new theoretical framework for the analysis of energy conservation in compressible flow is proposed, in a mathematical notation of square-root variables, inner products, and differential operator symmetries. As a result, the discrete equations exactly conserve not only the primary variables (mass, momentum and energy), but also the convective terms preserve (secondary) discrete kinetic and internal energy. Numerical experiments confirm that simulations are stable without the addition of artificial dissipation. Next, minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are reviewed, which try to minimize the dissipation needed for preventing sub-grid scales from polluting the numerical solution. A new model suitable for anisotropic grids is proposed: the anisotropic minimum-dissipation model. This model appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flow, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on anisotropic grids. The methods and models are first assessed on several academic test cases: channel flow, homogeneous decaying turbulence and the temporal mixing layer. As a practical application, accurate simulations of the transitional flow over a delta wing have been performed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In this work the Reduced-Order Subscales for Proper Orthogonal Decomposition models are presented. The basic idea consists in splitting the full-order solution into the part which can be captured by the reduced-order model and the part which cannot, the subscales, for which a model is required. The proposed model for the subscales is defined as a linear function of the solution of the reduced-order model. The coefficients of this linear function are obtained by comparing the solution of the full-order model with the solution of the reduced-order model for the same initial conditions, which, for convenience, are evaluated in the snapshots used to train the original reduced-order-model. The difference between both solutions are the subscales, for which a model can be built using a least-squares procedure. The subscales are then introduced as a correction in the reduced-order model, resulting in an important improvement in accuracy. The enhanced reduced-order model is tested in several numerical examples. These practical cases show that the use of the subscales leads to more accurate solutions, successfully corrects errors introduced by hyper-reduction, and allows to solve complex flow problems using a reduced number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an Arnoldi-like method based on the Koopman operator that analyzes empirical data, typically generated by nonlinear dynamics, and computes eigenvalues and eigenmodes of an approximate linear model. Without explicit knowledge of the dynamical operator, it extracts frequencies, growth rates, and spatial structures for each mode. We show that expansion in DMD modes is unique under certain conditions. When constructing mode-based reduced-order models of partial differential equations, subtracting a mean from the data set is typically necessary to satisfy boundary conditions. Subtracting the mean of the data exactly reduces DMD to the temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT); this is restrictive and generally undesirable. On the other hand, subtracting an equilibrium point generally preserves the DMD spectrum and modes. Next, we introduce an “optimized” DMD that computes an arbitrary number of dynamical modes from a data set. Compared to DMD, optimized DMD is superior at calculating physically relevant frequencies, and is less numerically sensitive. We test these decomposition methods on data from a two-dimensional cylinder fluid flow at a Reynolds number of 60. Time-varying modes computed from the DMD variants yield low projection errors.},

abstract = {We consider the computation of quadrature rules that are exact for a Chebyshev set of linearly independent functions on an interval {\$}[a,b]{\$}. A general theory of Chebyshev sets guarantees the existence of rules with a Gaussian property, in the sense that {\$}2l{\$} basis functions can be integrated exactly with just {\$}l{\$} points and weights. Moreover, all weights are positive and the points lie inside the interval {\$}[a,b]{\$}. However, the points are not the roots of an orthogonal polynomial or any other known special function as in the case of regular Gaussian quadrature. The rules are characterized by a nonlinear system of equations, and earlier numerical methods have mostly focused on finding suitable starting values for a Newton iteration to solve this system. In this paper we describe an alternative scheme that is robust and generally applicable for so-called complete Chebyshev sets. These are ordered Chebyshev sets where the first {\$}k{\$} elements also form a Chebyshev set for each {\$}k{\$}. The points of the quadrature rule are computed one by one, increasing exactness of the rule in each step. Each step reduces to finding the unique root of a univariate and monotonic function. As such, the scheme of this paper is guaranteed to succeed. The quadrature rules are of interest for integrals with non-smooth integrands that are not well approximated by polynomials.},

abstract = {Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) basis is predominantly used for model reduction in fluid dynamics. The robustness for changing operating conditions, numerical stability in long-term transient behavior and the pressure-term consideration are generally the main concerns of the Galerkin Reduced-Order Models (ROM). In this article, we present a novel procedure to construct an off-reference solution state by using an interpolated POD reduced basis. A linear interpolation of the POD reduced basis is performed by using two reference solution states. The POD basis functions are optimal in capturing the averaged flow energy. The energy dominant POD modes and corresponding base flow are interpolated according to the change in operating parameter. The solution state is readily built without performing the Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on the reduced POD space modes as well as the following time-integration of the resulted Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) to obtain the POD time coefficients. The proposed interpolation based approach is thus immune from the numerical issues associated with a standard POD-Galerkin ROM. In addition, a posteriori error estimate and a stability analysis of the obtained ROM solution are formulated. A detailed case study of the flow past a cylinder at low Reynolds numbers is considered for the demonstration of proposed method. The ROM results show good agreement with the high fidelity numerical flow simulation.},

Simulations show that, contrary to common belief, a perfectly staggered (checker-board) configuration does not necessarily give the highest average power output. Instead, the highest mean wind farm power output is found to depend on several factors, the most important one being the alignment that leads to minimization of wake effects from turbines in several upstream rows. This alignment typically occurs at significantly smaller angles than those corresponding to perfect staggering. The observed trends have implications for wind farm designs, especially in sites with a well-defined prevailing wind direction.},

In addition, in the treatment of inhomogeneous spatial directions of a flow, eigenfunctions that do not satisfy the boundary conditions are often used, and in the Galerkin projection the corresponding boundary conditions are ignored.

abstract = {All numerical calculations will fail to provide a reliable answer unless the continuous problem under consideration is well posed. Well-posedness depends in most cases only on the choice of boundary conditions. In this paper we will highlight this fact, and exemplify by discussing well-posedness of a prototype problem: the time-dependent compressible Navier–Stokes equations. We do not deal with discontinuous problems, smooth solutions with smooth and compatible data are considered. In particular, we will discuss how many boundary conditions are required, where to impose them and which form they should have in order to obtain a well posed problem. Once the boundary conditions are known, one issue remains; they can be imposed weakly or strongly. It is shown that the weak and strong boundary procedures produce similar continuous energy estimates. We conclude by relating the well-posedness results to energy-stability of a numerical approximation on summation-by-parts form. It is shown that the results obtained for weak boundary conditions in the well-posedness analysis lead directly to corresponding stability results for the discrete problem, if schemes on summation-by-parts form and weak boundary conditions are used. The analysis in this paper is general and can without difficulty be extended to any coupled system of partial differential equations posed as an initial boundary value problem coupled with a numerical method on summation-by parts form with weak boundary conditions. Our ambition in this paper is to give a general roadmap for how to construct a well posed continuous problem and a stable numerical approximation, not to give exact answers to specific problems.},

abstract = {Residual minimization is often used in constructing nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs) for engineering computations. In this paper, it is shown that for unsteady CFD applications, the performance of this method strongly depends on the chosen definition of the residual. To this effect, two common residual definitions are considered first. One is the standard residual associated with the governing high-dimensional discrete equations. The other is obtained by scaling the standard residual with the inverses of the volumes of the cells of the given CFD mesh. This second definition of the residual is common in high-dimensional CFD computations as it maximizes the accuracy of the computed results in the boundary layer regions where the spatial discretization is the finest. Using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing a reduced-order basis and residual minimization for computing a reduced-order approximation of a CFD solution using this basis, it is shown that both aforementioned residual definitions lead to nonlinear CFD ROMs that may perform poorly. For this reason, a new definition of the residual is proposed for the purpose of nonlinear model reduction. Unlike the two previous def- initions, this one is not biased by mesh spacing considerations. More importantly, using Burger's equation as a model CFD problem with shocks, and the Ahmed body problem as a representative of three-dimensional turbulent flow problems, the proposed definition of the residual is shown to lead to nonlinear ROMs that perform significantly better than their counterparts based of the first two aforementioned definitions of the CFD residual.},

The approach uses a low-dimensional basis function set that contains both global and local, goal-oriented basis functions. Compared to reduced-order models using the standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis, these new goal-oriented POD basis functions lead to better approximations of given quantities of interest (QoI) while maintaining accuracy in the evolution of the state. We demonstrate this approach for two problems involving Burgers equation. In the first problem, the QoI is the spatial average of the solution over various regions. The QoI in the second problem is the feedback control based on a MinMax control design with an extended Kalman filter. In both cases, approximations of the QoI and the state variables are more accurate using the goal-orientated POD than using the standard POD basis with comparable online computational costs.},

@article{Nguyen2014,
abstract = {This work presents an approach to solve inverse problems in the application of water qualitymanagement in reservoir systems. One such application is contaminant cleanup, which is challenging because tasks such as inferring the contaminant location and its distribution require large computational efforts and data storage requirements. In addition, real systems contain uncertain parameters such as wind velocity; these uncertainties must be accounted for in the inference problem. The approach developed here uses the combination of a reduced-ordermodel and a Bayesian inference formulation to rapidly determine contaminant locations given sparse measurements of contaminant concentration. The system is modelled by the coupled Navier-Stokes equations and convection-diffusion transport equations. The Galerkin finite elementmethod provides an approximate numerical solution-the 'full model', which cannot be solved in real-time. The proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection technique are applied to obtain a reduced-ordermodel that approximates the fullmodel. The Bayesian formulation of the inverse problem is solved using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for a variety of source locations in the domain. Numerical results show that applying the reduced-ordermodel to the source inversion problem yields a speed-up in computational time by a factor of approximately 32 with acceptable accuracy in comparison with the full model. Application of the inference strategy shows the potential effectiveness of this computationalmodeling approach for managing water quality.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {This paper is part of a program to combine a staggered time and staggered spatial discretization of continuum mechanics problems so that any property of the continuum that is proved using vector calculus can be proven in an analogous way for the discretized system. We require that the discretizations be second order accurate and have a conserved quantity that approximates the energy for the system and guarantees stability for a reasonable constraint on the time step. We also require that the discretization is time explicit so as to avoid the solution of large system of possibly nonlinear algebraic equations. The well known Yee grid discretization of Maxwell's equations is the same as our discretization and is an early example of using a staggered space and time grid . To motivate our discussion we begin by studying the staggered time or leapfrog discretization of the harmonic oscillator and use this to introduce the modification of the energy that is conserved. Next we use systems of linear equations to motivate the definition of the modified energy for more complex systems of ordinary differential equations and then apply our ideas to the scalar wave equation in one spatial dimension. We finish by discretizing the three dimensional scalar wave and Maxwell's equations. Because the spatial discretization is mimetic, we obtain that the divergence of the electric and magnetic fields are constant when there are no sources. Using the mimetic properties the proof of this trivial and is essentially the same as in the continuum.},

@article{Swischuk2018,
abstract = {This paper considers the creation of parametric surrogate models for applications in science and engineering where the goal is to predict high-dimensional output quantities of interest, such as pressure, temperature and strain fields. The proposed methodology develops a low-dimensional parametrization of these quantities of interest using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and combines this parametrization with machine learning methods to learn the map between the input parameters and the POD expansion coefficients. The use of particular solutions in the POD expansion provides a way to embed physical constraints, such as boundary conditions and other features of the solution that must be preserved. The relative costs and effectiveness of four different machine learning techniques—neural networks, multivariate polynomial regression, k-nearest-neighbors and decision trees—are explored through two engineering examples. The first example considers prediction of the pressure field around an airfoil, while the second considers prediction of the strain field over a damaged composite panel. The case studies demonstrate the importance of embedding physical constraints within learned models, and also highlight the important point that the amount of model training data available in an engineering setting is often much less than it is in other machine learning applications, making it essential to incorporate knowledge from physical models.},

The operation count for the on-line stage - in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate an output of interest - depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control. Particular attention is given (i) to the pressure treatment of incompressible Stokes problem; (ii) to find an equivalent inf-sup condition that guarantees stability of reduced basis solutions by enriching the reduced basis velocity approximation space with the solutions of a supremizer problem; (iii) to provide algebraic stability of the problem by reducing the condition number of reduced basis matrices using an orthonormalization procedure applied to basis functions; (iv) to reduce computational costs in order to allow real-time solution of parametrized problem. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

                  {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}The simulation of turbulent flows by means of computational fluid dynamics is highly challenging. The costs of an accurate direct numerical simulation (DNS) are usually too high, and engineers typically resort to cheaper coarse-grained models of the flow, such as large-eddy simulation (LES). To be suitable for the computation of turbulence, methods should not numerically dissipate the turbulent flow structures. Therefore, energy-conserving discretizations are investigated, which do not dissipate energy and are inherently stable because the discrete convective terms cannot spuriously generate kinetic energy. They have been known for incompressible flow, but the development of such methods for compressible flow is more recent. This paper will focus on the latter: LES and DNS for turbulent subsonic flow. A new theoretical framework for the analysis of energy conservation in compressible flow is proposed, in a mathematical notation of square-root variables, inner products, and differential operator symmetries. As a result, the discrete equations exactly conserve not only the primary variables (mass, momentum and energy), but also the convective terms preserve (secondary) discrete kinetic and internal energy. Numerical experiments confirm that simulations are stable without the addition of artificial dissipation. Next, minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are reviewed, which try to minimize the dissipation needed for preventing sub-grid scales from polluting the numerical solution. A new model suitable for anisotropic grids is proposed: the anisotropic minimum-dissipation model. This model appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flow, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on anisotropic grids. The methods and models are first assessed on several academic test cases: channel flow, homogeneous decaying turbulence and the temporal mixing layer. As a practical application, accurate simulations of the transitional flow over a delta wing have been performed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Pettersson2018,
abstract = {Stochastic physical problems governed by nonlinear conservation laws are challenging due to solution discontinuities in stochastic and physical space. In this paper, we present a level set method to track discontinuities in stochastic space by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. By introducing a speed function that vanishes at discontinuities, the iso-zero of the level set problem coincide with the discontinuities of the conservation law. The level set problem is solved on a sequence of successively finer grids in stochastic space. The method is adaptive in the sense that costly evaluations of the conservation law of interest are only performed in the vicinity of the discontinuities during the refinement stage. In regions of stochastic space where the solution is smooth, a surrogate method replaces expensive evaluations of the conservation law. The proposed method is tested in conjunction with different sets of localized orthogonal basis functions on simplex elements, as well as frames based on piecewise polynomials conforming to the level set function. The performance of the proposed method is compared to existing adaptive multi-element generalized polynomial chaos methods.},

abstract = {Finding suitable points for multivariate polynomial interpolation and approximation is a challenging task. Yet, despite this challenge, there has been tremendous research dedicated to this singular cause. In this paper, we begin by reviewing classical methods for finding suitable quadrature points for polynomial approximation in both the univariate and multivariate setting. Then, we categorize recent advances into those that propose a new sampling approach and those centered on an optimization strategy. The sampling approaches yield a favorable discretization of the domain, while the optimization methods pick a subset of the discretized samples that minimize certain objectives. While not all strategies follow this two-stage approach, most do. Sampling techniques covered include subsampling quadratures, Christoffel, induced and Monte Carlo methods. Optimization methods discussed range from linear programming ideas and Newton's method to greedy procedures from numerical linear algebra. Our exposition is aided by examples that implement some of the aforementioned strategies.},

Precautions in its application to random "elds with mean values and with a singular condition are also men- tioned. Furthermore, this paper introduces an example of the method's application to the evaluation of properties and the prediction of responses to wind forces acting on high-rise buildings; the validity of the method is also veri"ed. ?},

Both methods are assessed for two flow configurations: a two-dimensional flow around a square-cylinder for a Reynolds number of 100 and a three-dimensional flow past a backward-facing step for a Reynolds number of 7432 based on the step height and the streamwise velocity at the middle of the inlet.

abstract = {A reduced-order model for awind turbinewake is sought from large eddy simulation data. Fluc- tuating velocity fields are combined in the correlation tensor to form the kernel of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Proper orthogonal decomposition modes resulting from the decomposition represent the spatially coherent turbulence structures in the wind turbinewake; eigenvaluesdelineate the relative amountof turbulent kinetic energy associated with eachmode. Back-projecting thePODmodes onto the velocity snapshots produces dynamic coefficients that express the amplitude of each mode in time. A reduced-order model of the wind turbine wake (wakeROM)is defined through a series of polynomial parameters that quantify mode interaction and the evolution of each POD mode coefficients. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations models the wind turbine wake composed only of the large-scale turbulent dynam- ics identified by the POD. Tikhonov regularization is used to recalibrate the dynamical system by adding additional constraints to the minimization seeking polynomial parameters, reducing error in themodeled mode coefficients. The wakeROMis periodically reinitialized with new ini- tial conditions found by relating the incoming turbulent velocity to the POD mode coefficients through a series of open-loop transfer functions. ThewakeROMreproducesmodecoefficients to within25.2{\%},quantified throughthenormalizedroot-mean-squareerror. Ahigh-levelviewof the modeling approach is provided as a platform to discuss promising research directions, alternate processes that could benefit stability and efficiency, and desired extensions of thewakeROM},

@book{Holmes2012,
abstract = {For turbulent flows at relatively low speeds there exists an excellent mathematical model in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Why then is the "problem of turbulence" so difficult? One reason is that these nonlinear partial differential equations appear to be insoluble, except through numerical simulations, which offer useful approximations, but little direct understanding. Three recent developments offer new hope. First, the discovery by experimentalists of coherent structures in certain turbulent flows. Secondly, the suggestion that strange attractors and other ideas from finite dimensional dynamical systems theory might play a role in the analysis of the governing equations. And, finally, the introduction of the Karhunen Lo{\`{e}}ve or proper orthogonal decomposition. This book introduces these developments and describes how they may be combined to create low-dimensional models of turbulence, resolving only the coherent structures. This book will interest engineers, especially in the aerospace, chemical, civil, environmental and geophysical areas, as well as physicists and applied mathematicians concerned with turbulence.},

abstract = {This chapter presents an overview of Model Order Reduction – a new paradigm in the field of simulation-based engineering sciences, and one that can tackle the challenges and leverage the opportunities of modern ICT technologies. Despite the impressive progress attained by simulation capabilities and techniques, a number of challenging problems remain intractable. These problems are of different nature, but are common to many branches of science and engineering. Among them are those related to high-dimensional problems, problems involving very different time scales, models defined in degenerate domains with at least one of the characteristic dimensions much smaller than the others, model requiring real-time simulation, and parametric models. All these problems represent a challenge for standard mesh-based discretization techniques; yet the ability to solve these problems efficiently would open unexplored routes for real-time simulation, inverse analysis, uncertainty quantification and propagation, real-time optimization, and simulation-based control – critical needs in many branches of science and engineering. Model Order Reduction offers new simulation alternatives by circumventing, or at least alleviating, otherwise intractable computational challenges. In the present chapter we revisit three of these model reduction techniques: the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, the Proper Generalized Decomposition, and Reduced Basis methodologies.},

The conventional concept of (`Lipschitz') well-posedness in [Stuart 2010, Acta Numerica 19, pp. 451-559] is difficult to verify in practice, especially when considering blackbox models, and probably too strong in many contexts. Our concept replaces the Lipschitz continuity of the posterior measure in the Hellinger distance by just continuity. This weakening is tolerable, since the continuity is in general only used as a stability criterion. The main result of this article is a proof of well-posedness for a large class of Bayesian inverse problems, where very little or no information about the underlying model is available. It includes any Bayesian inverse problem arising when observing finite-dimensional data perturbed by additive, non-degenerate Gaussian noise. Moreover, well-posedness with respect to other probability metrics is investigated, including weak convergence, total variation, Wasserstein, and also the Kullback-Leibler divergence.},

abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) (also called Karhunen-Love expan- in turbulence to derive optimally fast converging bases of spatial func- tions, leading to efficient finite truncations. Whether a finite number of these modes can be used in numerical simulations to derive an "accurate" finite set of ordinary differential equations, over a certain range of bifurcation parameter values, still remains an open question. It is shown here that a necessary condition for achieving this goal is that the truncated system inherit the symmetry proper- ties of the original infinite-dimensional system. In most cases, this leads to a systematic involvement of the symmetry group in deriving a new expansion basis called the symmetric POD basis. The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with periodic boundary conditions is used as a paradigm to illus- trate this point of view. However, the conclusion is general and can be applied to other equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and others.},

abstract = {This report provides a “hands-on” introduction to the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the Galerkin method (GM). The POD is a technique to decompose a flow velocity field into spatial modes and time-dependent amplitudes. More specifically, POD extracts deterministic functions, associated with large-scale, energetic structures in a flow. If the governing equation of the field is known, the Galerkin method can be used to derive a system of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the time-dependent amplitudes. We focus on the application of the POD and the GM to fluid flows. Three examples are presented: a solution of the one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation, the two-dimensional Stuart solution and the three-dimensional (convecting) ABC flow. These examples serve as “prototypes” to show typical outcomes and problems associated with the POD and the GM. For all these examples, MATLAB source code is available to illustrate the practical implementation of the POD and GM.},

abstract = {A novel data-driven modal decomposition of fluid flow is proposed comprising key features of POD and DMD. The first mode is the normalized real or imaginary part of the DMD mode which minimizes the time-averaged residual. The N-th mode is defined recursively in an analogous manner based on the residual of an expansion using the first N-1 modes. The resulting recursive DMD (RDMD) modes are orthogonal by construction, retain pure frequency content and aim at low residual. RDMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked against POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al. 2012) for the same snapshot sequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have pure frequency content while retaining a residual of comparable order as POD. In contrast to DMD with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly identifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD outperforms both POD and DMD in the limit cycle resolution from the same snaphots. RDMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for empirical Galerkin models, with nonlinear transient dynamics as a niche application.},

Maths{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , vol. XLV, 1987, pp. 561–571) started these developments with snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition, a particularly simple method. The resulting reduced-order models provide valuable insights into flow physics, allow inexpensive explorations of dynamics and operating conditions, and enable model-based control design. A winning argument for proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is the optimality property, i.e. the guarantee of the least residual for a given number of modes. The price is unpleasant frequency mixing in the modes which complicates their physical interpretation. In contrast, temporal Fourier modes and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provide pure frequency dynamics but lose the orthonormality and optimality property of POD.

It is shown that the key to an accurate Galerkin model is a novel analytical pressure-term representation. The effect of the pressure term is elucidated by a modal energy-flow analysis in a mixing layer, which generalizes the framework developed by Rempfer (1991). In convectively unstable shear layers, it is shown in particular that neglecting small energy terms leads to large amplitude errors in the Galerkin model. The effect of the pressure term and small neglected energy flows is very important for a two-dimensional mixing layer, is less pronounced for the three-dimensional analogue, and can be considered as small in an absolutely unstable wake flow.},

abstract = {The computational approximation of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Navier-Stokes equations is often a formidable task. For this reason, there is significant interest in the development of very low-dimensional models that can be used to determine reasonably accurate approximations in simulation and control problems for PDEs. Many concrete tests have been reported on in the literature that show that several classes of reduced-order models (ROMs) are effective, i.e., an accurate approximate solution can be obtained using very low-dimensional ROMs. Most of these tests involved problems for which the solution depends on only a single parameter appearing in the boundary data. The extension of the techniques used in those tests to the case of multiple parameters is not a straightforward matter. Here, we present, test, and compare two methods for treating, within the context of a class of ROMs, inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary conditions that contain multiple parameters. In this study, we focus on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach to ROM; however, the issues and results discussed here in the POD context apply equally well to other ROM approaches. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This chapter reviews techniques of model reduction of fluid dynamics systems. Fluid systems are known to be difficult to reduce efficiently due to several reasons. First of all, they exhibit strong nonlinearities – which are mainly related either to nonlinear convection terms and/or some geometric variability – that often cannot be treated by simple linearization. Additional difficulties arise when attempt- ing model reduction of unsteady flows, especially when long-term transient behav- ior needs to be accurately predicted using reduced order models and more complex features, such as turbulence or multiphysics phenomena, have to be taken into con- sideration. We first discuss some general principles that apply to many parametric model order reduction problems, then we apply them on steady and unsteady vis- cous flows modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We address questions of inf-sup stability, certification through error estimation, computational issues and – in the unsteady case – long-time stability of the reduced model. More- over, we provide an extensive list of literature references.},

abstract = {In a previous work it has been shown that a one-dimensional, hyperbolic, transient five equations two-fluid model is able to numerically describe stratified, wavy, and slug flow in horizontal and near-horizontal pipes. Slug statistical characteristics can be numerically predicted with results in good agreement with experimental data and well-known empirical relations. In this model some approximated and simplified assumptions are adopted to describe shear stresses at wall and at phase interface. In this paper, we focus on the possibility to account for the cross sectional flow by inserting shape factors into the momentum balance equations of the aforementioned model. Velocity profiles are obtained by a pre-integrated model and they are computed at each time step and at each computational cell. Once that the velocity profiles are known, the obtained shape factors are inserted in the numerical resolution. In this way it is possible to recover part of the information lost due to the one-dimensional flow description. Velocity profiles computed in stratified conditions are compared against experimental profiles measured by PIV technique; a method to compute the velocity profile during slug initiation and growth has been developed and the computed velocity distribution in the liquid phase was compared against the one-seventh power law.},

abstract = {We present a simplified drift-flux model (DFM) describing a multiphase (gas-liquid) flow during drilling. The DFM uses a specific slip law, without flow-regime predictions, which allows for transition between single and two phase flows. With this model, we design an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for estimation of unmeasured states, production parameters and slip parameters using real time measurements of the bottom-hole pressure and liquid and gas rate at the outlet. The performance is tested against the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) by using OLGA simulations of typical drilling scenarios. The results show that both UKF and EKF are capable of identifying the production constants of gas from the reservoir into the well, while the UKF has better convergence rate compared with EKF.},

abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. Over the last three decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing tasks through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction. In this paper, we establish a new PDE-interpretation of deep convolution neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used for learning tasks involving speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning. Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.},

abstract = {We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {We propose to perform turbulent flow simulations in such manner that the difference operators do have the same symmetry properties as the underlying differential operators, i.e., the convective operator is represented by a skew-symmetric coefficient matrix and the diffusive operator is approximated by a symmetric, positive-definite matrix. Mimicking crucial properties of differential operators forms in itself a motivation for discretizing them in a certain manner. We give it a concrete form by noting that a symmetry-preserving discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations is stable on any grid, and conserves the total mass, momentum and kinetic energy (for the latter the physical dissipation is to be turned off, of coarse). Being stable on any grid, the choice of the grid may be based on the required accuracy solely, and the main question becomes: how accurate is a symmetry-preserving discretization? Its accuracy is tested for a turbulent flow in a channel by comparing the results to those of physical experiments and previous numerical studies. The comparison is carried out for a Reynolds number of 5600, which is based on the channel width and the mean bulk velocity (based on the channel half-width and wall shear velocity the Reynolds number becomes 180). The comparison shows that with a fourth-order, symmetry-preserving method a 64 × 64 × 32 grid suffices to perform an accurate numerical simulation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Tensor methods are among the most prominent tools for the numerical solution of high-dimensional problems where functions of multiple variables have to be approximated. These methods exploit the tensor structure of function spaces and apply to many problems in computational science which are formulated in tensor spaces, such as problems arising in stochastic calculus, uncertainty quantification or parametric analyses. Here, we present complexity reduction methods based on low-rank approximation methods. We analyze the problem of best approximation in subsets of low-rank tensors and discuss its connection with the problem of optimal model reduction in low-dimensional reduced spaces. We present different algorithms for computing approximations of a function in low-rank formats. In particular, we present constructive algorithms which are based either on a greedy construction of an approximation (with successive corrections in subsets of low-rank tensors) or on the greedy construction of tensor subspaces (for subspace-based low-rank formats). These algorithms can be applied for tensor compression, tensor completion or for the numerical solution of equations in low-rank tensor formats. A special emphasis is given to the solution of stochastic or parameter-dependent models. Different approaches are presented for the approximation of vector-valued or multivariate functions (identified with tensors), based on samples of the functions (black-box approaches) or on the models equations which are satisfied by the functions.},

abstract = {We are interested in nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form arising in fluid dynamics, and, for solutions containing shock waves, we investigate the convergence of finite difference schemes applied to such systems. According to Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat's theory, a shock wave theory for a given nonconservative system requires prescribing a priori a family of paths in the phase space. In the present paper, we consider schemes that are formally consistent with a given family of paths, and we investigate their limiting behavior as the mesh is refined. we first generalize to systems a property established earlier by Hou and LeFloch for scalar conservation laws, and we prove that nonconservative schemes generate, at the level of the limiting hyperbolic system, an convergence error source-term which, provided the total variation of the approximations remains uniformly bounded, is a locally bounded measure. This convergence error measure is supported on the shock trajectories and, as we demonstrate here, is usually "small". In the special case that the scheme converges in the sense of graphs - a rather strong convergence property often violated in practice - then this measure source-term vanishes. We also discuss the role of the equivalent equation associated with a difference scheme; here, the distinction between scalar equations and systems appears most clearly since, for systems, the equivalent equation of a scheme that is formally path-consistent depends upon the prescribed family of paths. The core of this paper is devoted to investigate numerically the approximation of several (simplified or full) hyperbolic models arising in fluid dynamics. This leads us to the conclusion that for systems having nonconservative products associated with linearly degenerate characteristic fields, the convergence error vanishes. For more general models, this measure is evaluated very accurately, especially by plotting the shock curves associated with each scheme under consideration; as we demonstrate, plotting the shock curves provide a convenient approach for evaluating the range of validity of a given scheme. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

The key components of active subspace methods are the eigenvectors of a symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix whose elements are the average products of partial derivatives of the simulation's input/output map. We study a Monte Carlo method for approximating the eigenpairs of this matrix. We offer both theoretical results based on recent non-asymptotic random matrix theory and a practical approach based on the bootstrap. We extend the analysis to the case when the gradients are approximated, for example, with finite differences. Our goal is to provide guidance for two questions that arise in active subspaces: (i) How many gradient samples does one need to accurately approximate the eigenvalues and subspaces? (ii) What can be said about the accuracy of the estimated subspace, both theoretically and practically? We test the approach on both simple quadratic functions where the active subspace is known and a parameterized PDE with 100 variables characterizing the coefficients of the differential operator.},

abstract = {Classical dimensional analysis has two limitations: (i) the computed dimensionless groups are not unique, and (ii) the analysis does not measure relative importance of the dimensionless groups. We propose two algorithms for estimating unique and relevant dimensionless groups assuming the experimenter can control the system's independent variables and evaluate the corresponding dependent variable; e.g., computer experiments provide such a setting. The first algorithm is based on a response surface constructed from a set of experiments. The second algorithm uses many experiments to estimate finite differences over a range of the independent variables. Both algorithms are semi-empirical because they use experimental data to complement the dimensional analysis. We derive the algorithms by combining classical semi-empirical modeling with active subspaces, which---given a probability density on the independent variables---yield unique and relevant dimensionless groups. The connection between active subspaces and dimensional analysis also reveals that all empirical models are ridge functions, which are functions that are constant along low-dimensional subspaces in its domain. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms on the well-studied example of viscous pipe flow---both turbulent and laminar cases. The results include a new set of two dimensionless groups for turbulent pipe flow that are ordered by relevance to the system; the precise notion of relevance is closely tied to the derivative based global sensitivity metric from Sobol' and Kucherenko.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art computer codes for simulating real physical systems are often characterized by vast number of input parameters. Performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics. One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters, one has to address the curse of dimensionality through suitable dimensionality reduction techniques. A popular class of dimensionality reduction methods are those that attempt to recover a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional feature space. However, such methods often tend to overestimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the input feature space. In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized nonlinear function of the low-dimensional projections of the input. We think of this low-dimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of the SPDE problem by lifting the assumption of fixed lengthscales of the uncertain diffusion field. Instead we attempt to solve a more challenging problem of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the response.},

@unpublished{Wu2018b,
abstract = {Using observation data to estimate unknown parameters in computational models is broadly important. This task is often challenging because solutions are non-unique due to the complexity of the model and limited observation data. However, the parameters or states of the model are often known to satisfy additional constraints beyond the model. Thus, we propose an approach to improve parameter estimation in such inverse problems by incorporating constraints in a Bayesian inference framework. Constraints are imposed by constructing a likelihood function based on fitness of the solution to the constraints. The posterior distribution of the parameters conditioned on (1) the observed data and (2) satisfaction of the constraints is obtained, and the estimate of the parameters is given by the maximum a posteriori estimation or posterior mean. Both equality and inequality constraints can be considered by this framework, and the strictness of the constraints can be controlled by constraint uncertainty denoting a confidence on its correctness. Furthermore, we extend this framework to an approximate Bayesian inference framework in terms of the ensemble Kalman filter method, where the constraint is imposed by re-weighing the ensemble members based on the likelihood function. A synthetic model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and in both the exact Bayesian inference and ensemble Kalman filter scenarios, numerical simulations show that imposing constraints using the method presented improves identification of the true parameter solution among multiple local minima.},

@phdthesis{Russi2010,
abstract = {This dissertation discusses uncertainty quantification as posed in the Data Collaboration framework. Data Collaboration is a methodology for combining experimental data and system models to induce constraints on a set of uncertain system parameters. The framework is summarized, including outlines of notation and techniques. The main techniques include polynomial optimization and surrogate modeling to ascertain the consistency of all data and models as well as propagate uncertainty in the form of a model prediction. One of the main methods of Data Collaboration is using techniques of nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming to provide both lower and upper bounds on the various objectives. The Lagrangian dual of the NQCQP provides both an outer bound to the optimal objective as well as Lagrange multipliers. These multipliers act as sensitivity measures relaying the effects of changes to the parameter constraint bounds on the optimal objective. These multipliers are rewritten to provide the sensitivity to uncertainty in the response prediction with respect to uncertainty in the parameters and experimental data. It is often of interest to find a vector of parameters that is both feasible and representative of the current community work and knowledge. This is posed as the problem of finding the minimal number of parameters that must deviate from their literature value to achieve concurrence with all experimental data constraints. This problem is heuristically solved using the L1-norm in place of the cardinality function. A lower bound on the objective is provided through an NQCQP formulation. In order to use the NQCQP techniques, the system models need to have quadratic forms. When they do not have quadratic forms, surrogate models are fitted. Surrogate modeling can be difficult for complex models with large numbers of parameters and long simulation times because of the amount of evaluation-time required to make a good fit. New techniques are developed for searching for an active subspace of the parameters, and subsequently creating an experiment design on the active subspace that adheres to the original parameter constraints. The active subspace can have a dimension significantly lower than the original parameter dimension thereby reducing the computational complexity of generating the surrogate model. The technique is demonstrated on several examples from combustion chemistry and biology. Several other applications of the Data Collaboration framework are presented. They are used to demonstrate the complexity of describing a high dimensional feasible set of parameter values as constrained by experimental data. Approximating the feasible set can lead to a simple description, but the predictive capability of such a set is significantly reduced compared to the actual feasible set. This is demonstrated on an example from combustion chemistry.},

However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

@article{Moore1981,
abstract = {Kalman's minimal realization theory involves geometric objects (controllable, unobservable subspaces) which are subject to structural instability. Specifically, arbitrarily small perturbations in a model may cause a change in the dimensions of the associated subspaces. This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX{\_}{\{}c{\}}, X{\_}{\{}bar{\{}o{\}}{\}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

abstract = {Linear stability of stratified two-phase flows in horizontal channels to arbitrary wavenumber disturbances is studied. The problem is reduced to Orr-Sommerfeld equations for the stream function disturbances, defined in each sublayer and coupled via boundary conditions that account also for possible interface deformation and capillary forces. Applying the Chebyshev collocation method, the equations and interface boundary conditions are reduced to the generalized eigenvalue problems solved by standard means of numerical linear algebra for the entire spectrum of eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors. Some additional conclusions concerning the instability nature are derived from the most unstable perturbation patterns. The results are summarized in the form of stability maps showing the operational conditions at which a stratified-smooth flow pattern is stable. It is found that for gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems, the stratified flow with a smooth interface is stable only in confined zone of relatively low flow rates, which is in agreement with experiments, but is not predicted by long-wave analysis. Depending on the flow conditions, the critical perturbations can originate mainly at the interface (so-called “interfacial modes of instability”) or in the bulk of one of the phases (i.e., “shear modes”). The present analysis revealed that there is no definite correlation between the type of instability and the perturbation wavelength.},

The effects of density and viscosity stratifications and surface tension on flow structures also have been investigated at various values of Froude numbers (channel inclinations). Multi-domain Chebyshev–Tau spectral methods along with MATLAB QZ eigenvalue solver are used to determine the whole spectrum of the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions. The neutral stability diagrams and stability boundaries are constructed for various values of flow parameters. The onset of flow transitions and flow structures predicted by linear stability analysis are compared against experimental results and they agree reasonably well. The results presented in the present paper imply that the shear mode of flow transitions is the one likely to be identified in experiments.},

In the long‐wave limit, mechanisms for linear instability, and the consequences of competition between mechanisms, are identified. For arbitrary wave numbers, air–water and olive oil–water systems are considered, in order to determine the influence of the channel thickness and the mean interfacial height on the stability of the flow. This paper characterizes those physical situations in which the primary instability is to long‐wave interfacial disturbances. The odd Orr–Sommerfeld shear mode within the water layer, which is necessarily stable in plane Poiseuille flow, is found to grow and even be the dominant mode of instability for the olive oil–water system.

abstract = {A physically-based computational technique was investigated which is intended to estimate an initial guess for complex values of the wavenumber of a disturbance leading to the solution of the fourth-order OrrSommerfeld (OS) equation. The complex wavenumbers, or eigenvalues, were associated with the stability characteristics of a semi-infinite shear flow represented by a hyperbolic-tangent function. This study was devoted to the examination of unstable flow assuming a spatially growing disturbance and is predicated on the fact that flow instability is correlated with elevated levels of perturbation kinetic energy per unit mass. A MATLAB computer program was developed such that the computational domain was selected to be in quadrant IV, where the real part of the wavenumber is positive and the imaginary part is negative to establish the conditions for unstable flow. For a given Reynolds number and disturbance wave speed, the perturbation kinetic energy per unit mass was computed at various node points in the selected subdomain of the complex plane. The initial guess for the complex wavenumber to start the solution process was assumed to be associated with the highest calculated perturbation kinetic energy per unit mass. Once the initial guess had been approximated, it was used to obtain the solution to the OS equation by performing a RungeKutta integration scheme that computationally marched from the far field region in the shear layer down to the lower solid boundary. Results compared favorably with the stability characteristics obtained from an earlier study for semi-infinite Blasius flow over a flat boundary. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This phenomenon has traditionally been investigated by linearizing the equations of flow and testing for unstable eigenvalues of the linearized problem, but the results of such investigations agree poorly in many cases with experiments. Nevertheless, linear effects play a central role in hydrodynamic instability. A reconciliation of these findings with the traditional analysis is presented based on the "pseudospectra" of the linearized problem, which imply that small perturbations to the smooth flow may be amplified by factors on the order of 10(5) by a linear mechanism even though all the eigenmodes decay monotonically. The methods suggested here apply also to other problems in the mathematical sciences that involve nonorthogonal eigenfunctions.},

abstract = {In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress ({\$}{\textgreater}50{\$}$\backslash${\%}) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.},

Under these circumstances the analysis gives two formulas, in closed form, for the growth rate and phase velocity of the waves in terms of the wavenumber and other relevant parameters, including the Froude number F representing the gravity effect and a parameter S representing the surface-tension effect. In the calculation, the wavenumber is not restricted in any way, The wavenumber of the waves that one expects to observe is that for which the growth rate is the maximum. The instability is one in which the viscosity difference between the two fluids (air and liquid) plays the dominant role, and is of the kind found by Yih (1967).},

@article{Kim2018,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel generative model to synthesize fluid simulations from a set of reduced parameters. A convolutional neural network is trained on a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are generated up to 700x faster than re-simulating the data with the underlying CPU solver, while achieving compression rates of up to 1300x.},

abstract = {Turbulence-resolving simulations of wind turbine wakes are presented using a high--order flow solver combined with both a standard and a novel dynamic implicit spectral vanishing viscosity (iSVV and dynamic iSVV) model to account for subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses. The numerical solutions are compared against wind tunnel measurements, which include mean velocity and turbulent intensity profiles, as well as integral rotor quantities such as power and thrust coefficients. For the standard (also termed static) case the magnitude of the spectral vanishing viscosity is selected via a heuristic analysis of the wake statistics, while in the case of the dynamic model the magnitude is adjusted both in space and time at each time step. The study focuses on examining the ability of the two approaches, standard (static) and dynamic, to accurately capture the wake features, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results suggest that the static method can become over-dissipative when the magnitude of the spectral viscosity is increased, while the dynamic approach which adjusts the magnitude of dissipation locally is shown to be more appropriate for a non-homogeneous flow such that of a wind turbine wake.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {Within the BEPU (Best Estimate plus Uncertainty) methodology uncertainties must be quantified in order to prove that the investigated design remains within acceptance criteria. For best-estimate system thermal-hydraulics codes like TRACE and RELAP5, significant uncertainties come from the closure laws which are used to describe transfer terms in the balance equations. The accuracy and uncertainty information of these correlations are usually unknown to the code users, which results in the user simply ignoring or describing them using expert opinion or personal judgment during uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The purpose of this paper is to replace such ad-hoc expert judgment of the uncertainty information of TRACE physical model parameters with inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) based on OECD/NRC BWR Full-size Fine-Mesh Bundle Tests (BFBT) benchmark steady-state void fraction data. Inverse UQ seeks statistical descriptions of the physical model random input parameters that are consistent with the experimental data. Inverse UQ always captures the uncertainty of its estimates rather than merely determining point estimates of the best-fit input parameters. Bayesian analysis is used to establish the inverse UQ problems based on experimental data, with systematic and rigorously derived surrogate models based on Sparse Gird Stochastic Collocation (SGSC). Global sensitivity analysis including Sobol' indices and correlation coefficients are used to identify the important TRACE input parameters. Several adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques are investigated and implemented to explore the posterior probability density functions. This research solves the problem of lack of uncertainty information for TRACE physical model parameters for the closure relations. The quantified uncertainties are necessary for future uncertainty and sensitivity study of TRACE code in nuclear reactor system design and safety analysis.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to find out the efficient extraction of pharmacologically important analogue capsaicinoids in different organic solvents of Capsicum chinense Bhut Jolokia fruits. Non polar solvents (Hexane, Benzene, Chloroform and Diethyl ether), Polar Aprotic solvents (Ethyl acetate, Acetone, Acetonitrile and Dimethyl sulfoxide-DMSO) and Polar Protic solvents (n-Propanol, Ethanol, Methanol and Water) were used for the extraction. The crude extracts were subjected to TLC for the qualitative examination for the presence of capsaicinoids. The simple linear regression curve was plotted for standard capsaicin purchased from Sigma Chemical. For the quantitative estimation UV-visible spectrophotometer analysis and phosphomolybdic reduction method of total capsaicin were performed. The total phenol content in the extracts was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteu acid reagent method. The TLC profile with retention factor 0.078 corresponding to standard capsaicin was observed in all extracts except DMSO. Among the 12 tested solvents, acetone and acetonitrile showed high pungency level with 1,347,439 SHU and 1,266,250 SHU respectively, followed by ethanol with pungency level of 1,246,523 SHU. The non polar solvent (hexane, benzene, chloroform) and polar protic solvents (methanol and water) showed the value less than 1,000,000 SHU. In the comparative study on the UV, total phenol and total capsaicin estimation reveals that acetone and acetonitrile solvents were efficient to extract the high amount capsaicinoids. Our results with the solvents used for the extraction showed diverse solubility of capsaicinoid. Hence this study concludes that polar aprotic solvents acetonitrile and acetone were the best solvent system for the efficient extraction of capsaicinoids for pharmacological and biological application.},

The latter two representations require use of the QZ algorithm in the resolution of the singular generalised matrix eigenvalue problem which arises. Physical problems explored are those of Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, pressure gradient driven circular pipe flow, and Couette and Poiseuille problems for two viscous, immiscible fluids, one overlying the other.},

abstract = {Deep learning has attracted tremendous attention from researchers in various fields of information engineering such as AI, computer vision, and language processing [Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Mnih et al., 2013], but also from more traditional sciences such as physics, biology, and manufacturing [Anjos et al., 2015; Baldi et al., 2014; Bergmann et al., 2014]. Neural networks, image processing tools such as convolutional neural networks, sequence processing models such as recurrent neural networks, and regularisation tools such as dropout, are used extensively. However, fields such as physics, biology, and manufacturing are ones in which representing model uncertainty is of crucial importance [Ghahramani, 2015; Krzywinski and Altman, 2013]. With the recent shift in many of these fields towards the use of Bayesian uncertainty [Herzog and Ostwald, 2013; Nuzzo, 2014; Trafimow and Marks, 2015], new needs arise from deep learning. In this work we develop tools to obtain practical uncertainty estimates in deep learning, casting recent deep learning tools as Bayesian models without changing either the models or the optimisation. In the first part of this thesis we develop the theory for such tools, providing applications and illustrative examples. We tie approximate inference in Bayesian models to dropout and other stochastic regularisation techniques, and assess the approximations empirically. We give example applications arising from this connection between modern deep learning and Bayesian modelling such as active learning of image data and data efficient deep reinforcement learning. We further demonstrate the method's practicality through a survey of recent applications making use of the suggested tools in language applications, medical diagnostics, bioinformatics, image processing, and autonomous driving. In the second part of the thesis we explore its theoretical implications, and the insights stemming from the link between Bayesian modelling and deep learning. We discuss what determines model uncertainty properties, analyse the approximate inference analytically in the linear case, and theoretically examine various priors such as spike and slab priors.},

abstract = {Least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) model-reduction techniques such as the Gauss–Newton with Approximated Tensors (GNAT) method have shown promise, as they have generated stable, accurate solutions for large-scale turbulent, compressible flow problems where standard Galerkin techniques have failed. However, there has been limited comparative analysis of the two approaches. This is due in part to difficulties arising from the fact that Galerkin techniques perform optimal projection associated with residual minimization at the time-continuous level, while LSPG techniques do so at the time-discrete level. This work provides a detailed theoretical and computational comparison of the two techniques for two common classes of time integrators: linear multistep schemes and Runge–Kutta schemes. We present a number of new findings, including conditions under which the LSPG ROM has a time-continuous representation, conditions under which the two techniques are equivalent, and time-discrete error bounds for the two approaches. Perhaps most surprisingly, we demonstrate both theoretically and computationally that decreasing the time step does not necessarily decrease the error for the LSPG ROM; instead, the time step should be ‘matched' to the spectral content of the reduced basis. In numerical experiments carried out on a turbulent compressible-flow problem with over one million unknowns, we show that increasing the time step to an intermediate value decreases both the error and the simulation time of the LSPG reduced-order model by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {This work proposes a method for model reduction of finite-volume models that guarantees the resulting reduced-order model is conservative, thereby preserving the structure intrinsic to finite-volume discretizations. The proposed reduced-order models associate with optimization problems characterized by a minimum-residual objective function and nonlinear equality constraints that explicitly enforce conservation over subdomains. Conservative Galerkin projection arises from formulating this optimization problem at the time-continuous level, while conservative least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection associates with a time-discrete formulation. We equip these approaches with hyper-reduction techniques in the case of nonlinear flux and source terms, and also provide approaches for handling infeasibility. In addition, we perform analyses that include deriving conditions under which conservative Galerkin and conservative LSPG are equivalent, as well as deriving a posteriori error bounds. Numerical experiments performed on a parameterized quasi-1D Euler equation demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to ensure not only global conservation, but also significantly lower state-space errors than nonconservative reduced-order models such as standard Galerkin and LSPG projection.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction-diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

We concentrate on the question how to handle difficulties that arise when these "standard" techniques are applied to the stability problem of a thin film of liquid that is sheared by a gas. After discussing this specific problem in detail, it is argued that the method of solution can readily be applied to other two-phase flow configurations as well. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate theoretically and computationally the conservation properties of reduced order models (ROMs) for fluid flows. Specifically, we investigate whether the ROMs satisfy the same (or similar) energy balance and mass conservation as those satisfied by the Navier–Stokes equations. All of our theoretical findings are illustrated and tested in numerical simulations of a 2D flow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number Re=100. First, we investigate the ROM energy balance. We show that using the snapshot average for the centering trajectory (which is a popular treatment of nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in ROMs) yields an incorrect energy balance. Then, we propose a new approach, in which we replace the snapshot average with the Stokes extension. Theoretically, the Stokes extension produces an accurate energy balance. Numerically, the Stokes extension yields more accurate results than the standard snapshot average, especially for longer time intervals. Our second contribution centers around ROM mass conservation. We consider ROMs created using two types of finite elements: the standard Taylor–Hood (TH) element, which satisfies the mass conservation weakly, and the Scott–Vogelius (SV) element, which satisfies the mass conservation pointwise. Theoretically, the error estimates for the SV-ROM are sharper than those for the TH-ROM. Numerically, the SV-ROM yields significantly more accurate results, especially for coarser meshes and longer time intervals.},

Firstly, two kinds of operating condition with different thrust coefficients under two types of inflow with different ambient turbulence intensity are simulated for a model and a utility-scale wind turbine by using large eddy simulation (LES). The predicted mean velocity and turbulence intensity in the wakes of two wind turbines are compared with those obtained from the wind tunnel tests to validate numerical models. Subsequently, a new wake model is proposed to predict the mean velocity and turbulence intensity distribution in the wake regions of wind turbines. The model is derived based on the axial symmetry and self-similarity assumption for wake deficit and added turbulence intensity. All parameters of the proposed model are determined as the function of ambient turbulence intensity and thrust coefficient identified based on the various large eddy simulations. The velocity deficit and added turbulence intensity in the wake predicted by the new wake model show good agreement with the LES simulations and experimental results in the near and far wake regions.},

This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The code is validated by comparisons with the temporal linear theory for moderate density and viscosity ratios, which basically corresponds to atomization processes in high pressure chambers.

abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering analysis, design and optimization. While the predictive capability of RANS models depends on many factors, for many practical flows the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. As RANS models are used in the design and safety evaluation of many mission-critical systems such as airplanes and nuclear power plants, quantifying their model-form uncertainties has significant implications in enabling risk-informed decision-making. In this work we develop a data-driven, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Both cases are challenging for standard RANS turbulence models. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the obtained posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the models are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many fields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.},

However, conventional reduced basis methods do not generally preserve conservation laws and symmetries of the full order model. Here, we present an approach for reduced model construction, that preserves the symplectic symmetry of dissipative Hamiltonian systems. The method constructs a closed reduced Hamiltonian system by coupling the full model with a canonical heat bath. This allows the reduced system to be integrated with a symplectic integrator, resulting in a correct dissipation of energy, preservation of the total energy and, ultimately, in the stability of the solution. Accuracy and stability of the method are illustrated through the numerical simulation of the dissipative wave equation and a port-Hamiltonian model of an electric circuit.},

@article{Wu2018,
abstract = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high fidelity simulations (Physics informed machine learning approach for reconstructing Reynolds stress modeling discrepancies based on DNS data. Physical Review Fluids. 2, 034603, 2017). However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities are of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (QoIs, e.g., drag, lift, surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrated merits of the proposed framework.},

@article{Bilger2017,
abstract = {Two principal methods have been used to simulate the evolution of two-phase immiscible flows of liquid and gas separated by an interface. These are the Level-Set (LS) method and the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method. Both methods attempt to represent the very sharp interface between the phases and to deal with the large jumps in physical properties associated with it. Both methods have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the VoF method is known to be prone to excessive numerical diffusion, while the basic LS method has some difficulty in conserving mass. Major progress has been made in remedying these deficiencies, and both methods have now reached a high level of physical accuracy. Nevertheless, there remains an issue, in that each of these methods has been developed by different research groups, using different codes and most importantly the implementations have been fine tuned to tackle different applications. Thus, it remains unclear what are the remaining advantages and drawbacks of each method relative to the other, and what might be the optimal way to unify them. In this paper, we address this gap by performing a direct comparison of two current state-of-the-art variations of these methods (LS: RCLSFoam and VoF: interPore) and implemented in the same code (OpenFoam). We subject both methods to a pair of benchmark test cases while using the same numerical meshes to examine a) the accuracy of curvature representation, b) the effect of tuning parameters, c) the ability to minimise spurious velocities and d) the ability to tackle fluids with very different densities. For each method, one of the test cases is chosen to be fairly benign while the other test case is expected to present a greater challenge. The results indicate that both methods can be made to work well on both test cases, while displaying different sensitivity to the relevant parameters.},

abstract = {In the recent years, considerable attention has been paid to preserving structures and invariants in reduced basis methods, in order to enhance the stability and robustness of the reduced system. In the context of Hamiltonian systems, symplectic model reduction seeks to construct a reduced system that preserves the symplectic symmetry of Hamiltonian systems. However, symplectic methods are based on the standard Euclidean inner products and are not suitable for problems equipped with a more general inner product. In this paper, we generalize symplectic model reduction to allow for the norms and inner products that are most appropriate to the problem while preserving the symplectic symmetry of the Hamiltonian systems. To construct a reduced basis and accelerate the evaluation of nonlinear terms, a greedy generation of a symplectic basis is proposed. Furthermore, it is shown that the greedy approach yields a norm-bounded reduced basis. The accuracy and the stability of this model reduction technique are illustrated through the development of reduced models for a vibrating elastic beam and the sine-Gordon equation.},

@book{Ballreich2017,
abstract = {The second chapter begins with the description of the elementary concepts of Bayesian filter theory. Based on these concepts, popular filter algorithms for discrete time linear and nonlinear filtering problems are derived, namely the discrete Bayes filter, the Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter (Julier et al. 1995). Furthermore, a large part of the chapter is devoted to parameter estimation, particularly to the Bayesian estimation of parameters. Here the fact that it is not possible to perform Bayesian estimation of diffusion parameters by using the nonlinear Kalman filter is analysed in detail. As a solution to this problem, the conditional filter of Singer (2015) is reviewed. In the first part of the third chapter, classical approaches to one-dimensional deterministic integration are presented. The second part is devoted to multidimensional deterministic integration and focuses on the two concepts used for the computation of own cubature rules. These are the multidimensional moment equations and the Smolyak algorithm. From the moment equations, two cubature methods of exactness m D 3 frequently used for the purpose of filtering are derived. Those are the unscented transform of Julier et al. (1995) and the cubature rule of Arasaratnam and Haykin (2009). Additionally, the relationship between the cubature rule of Arasaratnam and the rule of Stroud and Secrest (1963) is pointed out. At the end of the chapter, a cubature method is reviewed, which is based on the decomposition of the integration domain. The associated rules are called compound rules. The fourth chapter comprises the main research results with respect to the creation of own cubature rules. The so-called AE rules (approximate exactness), described in Sect. 4.1, are constructed based on a least squares approach to the moment equations. Due to the resulting small approximation errors, these rules have an approximative degree of polynomial exactness. This means that the arising cubature rules from the outset are constructed in a way that slight inaccuracies with respect to the integration of polynomials are tolerated. The weights used by the4 1 Introduction computed rules are strictly positive and therefore the level of stability is optimal. Ignoring the small approximation errors, no other rules known from literature which use strictly positive weights are more efficient than the AE rules. Furthermore, in most of cases under consideration, the new rules use less abscissae than the most efficient rules known from literature in general. In Sect. 4.2. an algorithm for the computation of new kinds of Smolyak cubature rules is derived. This approach is used in order to generate rules which are of higher exactness and are usable for higher dimensions than the AE rules. The first two types of new Smolyak cubature rules are the stabilized(1) and stabilized(2) rules. Both kinds of rules are constructed with the focus lying mainly on stability. The stabilized(1) rules are less efficient than other rules known from literature, but significantly more stable. An extension to this approach leads to the stabilized(2) rules, which are characterized by a higher efficiency and lower stability compared to the stabilized(1) rules. Although the considerable increase of efficiency leads to a reduction of stability, the degree of stability achieved is still very high. The third kind of self-constructed Smolyak cubature rules are the Smolyak-AE rules (Smolyak cubature rules of approximate exactness). The algorithm applied is based on the idea of shrinking some of the weights towards zero. These weights then can be omitted because their influence on the cubature result is negligible. However, omitting some of the weights, even if they are very small, always leads to small inaccuracies with regard to the cubature rule. Therefore, the Smolyak-AE rules have an approximate degree of exactness. Neglecting the small inaccuracies, these rules are more efficient than all other rules known from literature. As far as stability is concerned, the Smolyak-AE rules outperform the Smolyak cubature rules of Heiss and Winschel. In the fifth chapter, the performance of the self-created rules is compared to the performance of the Smolyak cubature rules proposed by Heiss and Winschel. For this purpose, the filter algorithms described in the first chapter are equipped with AE/Smolyak-AE as well as with the comparing Smolyak cubature rules, and applied within four simulation studies.},

abstract = {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data” useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

abstract = {Several multiscale methods account for sub-grid scale features using coarse scale basis functions. For example, in the Multiscale Finite Volume method the coarse scale basis functions are obtained by solving a set of local problems over dual-grid cells. We introduce a data-driven approach for the estimation of these coarse scale basis functions. Specifically, we employ a neural network predictor fitted using a set of solution samples from which it learns to generate subsequent basis functions at a lower computational cost than solving the local problems. The computational advantage of this approach is realized for uncertainty quantification tasks where a large number of realizations has to be evaluated. We attribute the ability to learn these basis functions to the modularity of the local problems and the redundancy of the permeability patches between samples. The proposed method is evaluated on elliptic problems yielding very promising results.},

The uncertainties are characterized as aleatoric (physical uncertainty) or epistemic (statistical, measurement and model uncertainties). Methods for uncertainty modeling consistent with methods for estimating the reliability are described. It is described how uncertainties in wind turbine design related to computational models, statistical data from test specimens, results from a few full-scale tests and from prototype wind turbines can be accounted for using the Maximum Likelihood Method and a Bayesian approach. Assessment of the optimal reliability level by cost-benefit optimization is illustrated by an offshore wind turbine example.

abstract = {Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) has non-uniform convergence and tends to break down for long-time integration. The reason is that the probability density distribution (PDF) of the solution evolves as a function of time. The set of orthogonal polynomials associated with the initial distribution will therefore not be optimal at later times, thus causing the reduced efficiency of the method for long-time integration. Adaptation of the set of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the changing PDF removes the error with respect to long-time integration. In this method new stochastic variables and orthogonal polynomials are constructed as time progresses. In the new stochastic variable the solution can be represented exactly by linear functions. This allows the method to use only low order polynomial approximations with high accuracy. The method is illustrated with a simple decay model for which an analytic solution is available and subsequently applied to the three mode Kraichnan-Orszag problem with favorable results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics informed deep learning framework capable of encoding an important class of physical laws governing fluid motions, namely the Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we seek to leverage the underlying conservation laws (i.e., for mass, momentum, and energy) to infer hidden quantities of interest such as velocity and pressure fields merely from spatio-temporal visualizations of a passive scaler (e.g., dye or smoke), transported in arbitrarily complex domains (e.g., in human arteries or brain aneurysms). Our approach towards solving the aforementioned data assimilation problem is unique as we design an algorithm that is agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. This makes HFM highly flexible in choosing the spatio-temporal domain of interest for data acquisition as well as subsequent training and predictions. Consequently, the predictions made by HFM are among those cases where a pure machine learning strategy or a mere scientific computing approach simply cannot reproduce. The proposed algorithm achieves accurate predictions of the pressure and velocity fields in both two and three dimensional flows for several benchmark problems motivated by real-world applications. Our results demonstrate that this relatively simple methodology can be used in physical and biomedical problems to extract valuable quantitative information (e.g., lift and drag forces or wall shear stresses in arteries) for which direct measurements may not be possible.},

We propose a design criteria for a volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithm to be second-order accurate. Namely, that it reproduce lines in two space dimensions or planes in three space dimensions exactly. We also introduce a second-order, unsplit, volume-of-fluid advection algorithm that is based on a second-order, finite difference method for scalar conservation laws due to Bell, Dawson and Shubin. We test this advection algorithm by modeling several different interface shapes propagating in two simple incompressible flows and compare the results with the standard second-order, operator-split advection algorithm. Although both methods are second-order accurate when the interface is smooth, we find that the unsplit algorithm exhibits noticeably better resolution in regions where the interface has discontinuous derivatives, such as at corners. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsvier Inc.},

abstract = {The Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) model with interface-capturing scheme, available in many commercial and open-source CFD packages, may be widely used for simulations of free-surface hydrodynamics but is certainly not used without difficulties. While practitioners have come to expect conservation of mass and momentum, unconditional stability, second-order of accuracy and good iterative convergence, none of these qualities are evident when a free surface gets involved. In this paper, we investigate how these qualities are affected by the discontinuous nature of the volume fraction, which requires specialized numerical techniques for advection, for the interpolation of material properties, for the hydrostatic balance and for the pressure-weighted interpolation used in finite-volume methods with co-located variables. We find that conservation properties and good iterative convergence can still be attained, but not second-order of accuracy and unconditional stability. Code verification is presented to substantiate these findings, with cases ranging from one to three dimensions, from uniform to locally refined grids and from the stand-alone volume fraction equation to the complete set of mass, momentum and volume fraction equations. For the latter, a novel manufactured solution based on a sinusoidal wave in deep water is introduced. These tests permit not only to quantitatively assess the results for comparison with theoretical predictions but also ensure that our findings are characteristic of the VoF method and not of a particular implementation.},

abstract = {New time integration methods are proposed for simulating incompressible multiphase flow in pipelines described by the one-dimensional two-fluid model. The methodology is based on 'half-explicit' Runge-Kutta methods, being explicit for the mass and momentum equations and implicit for the volume constraint. These half-explicit methods are constraint-consistent, i.e., they satisfy the hidden constraints of the two-fluid model, namely the volumetric flow (incompressibility) constraint and the Poisson equation for the pressure. A novel analysis shows that these hidden constraints are present in the continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete equations. Next to constraint-consistency, the new methods are conservative: the original mass and momentum equations are solved, and the proper shock conditions are satisfied; efficient: the implicit constraint is rewritten into a pressure Poisson equation, and the time step for the explicit part is restricted by a CFL condition based on the convective wave speeds; and accurate: achieving high order temporal accuracy for all solution components (masses, velocities, and pressure). High-order accuracy is obtained by constructing a new third order Runge-Kutta method that satisfies the additional order conditions arising from the presence of the constraint in combination with time-dependent boundary conditions. Two test cases (Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a pipeline and liquid sloshing in a cylindrical tank) show that for time-independent boundary conditions the half-explicit formulation with a classic fourth-order Runge-Kutta method accurately integrates the two-fluid model equations in time while preserving all constraints. A third test case (ramp-up of gas production in a multiphase pipeline) shows that our new third order method is preferred for cases featuring time-dependent boundary conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper, some aspects of water impact and green water loading are considered by numerically investigating a dambreak problem and water entry problems. The numerical method is based on the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid. The equations are discretised on a fixed Cartesian grid using the finite volume method. Even though very small cut cells can appear when moving an object through the fixed grid, the method is stable. The free surface is displaced using the Volume-of-Fluid method together with a local height function, resulting in a strictly mass conserving method. The choice of boundary conditions at the free surface appears to be crucial for the accuracy and robustness of the method. For validation, results of a dambreak simulation are shown that can be compared with measurements. A box has been placed in the flow, as a model for a container on the deck of an offshore floater on which forces are calculated. The water entry problem has been investigated by dropping wedges with different dead-rise angles, a cylinder and a cone into calm water with a prescribed velocity. The resulting free surface dynamics, with the sideways jets, has been compared with photographs of experiments. Also a comparison of slamming coefficients with theory and experimental results has been made. Finally, a drop test with a free falling wedge has been simulated. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This method combines some of the advantages of the volume-of-fluid method with the level set method to obtain a method which is generally superior to either method alone. We present direct comparisons between computations made with the CLSVOF method and computations made with the level set method, the volume-of-fluid method, and the boundary integral method. We also compare our computations to the exact solution for an oscillating ellipse due to Lamb and experimental results obtained for a rising gas bubble in liquid obtained by Hnat and Buckmaster.

@phdthesis{VanderPijl2005,
abstract = {The subject of this thesis is the computation of bubbly flows. Bubbly flows occur for example in chemical reactors, boiling, fuel injectors and coating. The bubbles and the surrounding fluid are modeled directly without phase averaging. This is the most fundamental approach of describing multi-phase flows. Every bubble is modeled in great detail. Since the model is so demanding, an efficient numerical approach has to be taken. This work aims to develop an efficient, robust method for the direct numerical simulation of multi-phase flows. There exist two incompressible fluids (e.g. air and water) that are separated by an interface. The interface is a moving, internal boundary, where density and viscosity change discontinuously and surface tension forces act. When the governing equations are discretized, the question arises how to deal with this interface. Various methods have been put forward to treat moving boundary problems. The two methods that are of most interest are the so-called Volume-of-Fluid method and the Level-Set method. With both methods a coloring function is used to identify the individual phase. The interface is implicitly defined, which allows arbitrarily shaped interface. The advection of the interface is the key part of this thesis, for which the Level-Set approach is chosen. The major disadvantage of the Level-Set method is that the mass of each individual phase is not conserved when the interface is advected. Additional effort is necessary and in this research the Volume-of-Fluid function is used to conserve mass. The method is applied to a falling drop and a rising bubble in two and three dimensions, respectively. Merging of rising bubbles is studied for two aligned and two misaligned bubbles. Comparison with other numerical work and experimental data is made.},

This Continuous Level Monte Carlo (CLMC) estimator provides a natural framework in PDE applications to adapt the model hierarchy to each sample. In addition, it can be made unbiased with respect to the expected value of the true quantity of interest provided the quantity of interest converges sufficiently fast. The practical implementation of the CLMC estimator is based on interpolating actual evaluations of the quantity of interest at a finite number of resolutions. As our new level parameter, we use the logarithm of a goal-oriented finite element error estimator for the accuracy of the quantity of interest. We prove the unbiasedness, as well as a complexity theorem that shows the same rate of complexity for CLMC as for MLMC. Finally, we provide some numerical evidence to support our theoretical results, by successfully testing CLMC on a standard PDE test problem. The numerical experiments demonstrate clear gains for sample-wise adaptive refinement strategies over uniform refinements.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks have become invaluable tools for supervised machine learning, e.g., classification of text or images. While often offering superior results over traditional techniques and successfully expressing complicated patterns in data, deep architectures are known to be challenging to design and train such that they generalize well to new data. Important issues with deep architectures are numerical instabilities in derivative-based learning algorithms commonly called exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper we propose new forward propagation techniques inspired by systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) that overcome this challenge and lead to well-posed learning problems for arbitrarily deep networks. The backbone of our approach is our interpretation of deep learning as a parameter estimation problem of nonlinear dynamical systems. Given this formulation, we analyze stability and well-posedness of deep learning and use this new understanding to develop new network architectures. We relate the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomenon to the stability of the discrete ODE and present several strategies for stabilizing deep learning for very deep networks. While our new architectures restrict the solution space, several numerical experiments show their competitiveness with state-of-the-art networks.},

@article{Jay2007,
abstract = {There are two parts in this paper. In the first part we consider an overdetermined system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). We are particularly concerned with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems with holonomic constraints. The main motivation is in finding methods based on Gauss coefficients, preserving not only the constraints, symmetry, symplecticness, and variational nature of trajectories of holonomically constrained Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems, but also having optimal order of convergence. The new class of (s, s)-Gauss-Lobatto specialized partitioned additive Runge-Kutta (SPARK) methods uses greatly the structure of the DAEs and possesses all desired properties. In the second part we propose a unified approach for the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) mixing analytical solutions and numerical approximations. The basic idea is to consider local models which can be solved efficiently, for example analytically, and to incorporate their solution into a global procedure based on standard numerical integration methods for the correction. In order to preserve also symmetry we define the new class of symmetrized Runge-Kutta methods with local model (SRKLM). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Eggels2017,
abstract = {In this article, we propose the use of partitioning and clustering methods as an alternative to Gaussian quadrature for stochastic collocation (SC). The key idea is to use cluster centers as the nodes for collocation. In this way, we can extend the use of collocation methods to uncertainty propagation with multivariate, correlated input. The approach is particularly useful in situations where the probability distribution of the input is unknown, and only a sample from the input distribution is available. We examine several clustering methods and assess their suitability for stochastic collocation numerically using the Genz test functions as benchmark. The proposed methods work well, most notably for the challenging case of nonlinearly correlated inputs in higher dimensions. Tests with input dimension up to 16 are included. Furthermore, the clustering-based collocation methods are compared to regular SC with tensor grids of Gaussian quadrature nodes. For 2-dimensional uncorrelated inputs, regular SC performs better, as should be expected, however the clustering-based methods also give only small relative errors. For correlated 2-dimensional inputs, clustering-based collocation outperforms a simple adapted version of regular SC, where the weights are adjusted to account for input correlation.},

In this paper, we propose a {\{}$\backslash$it physically-constrained{\}} DDF-ROM (CDDF-ROM), which aims at improving the physical accuracy of the DDF-ROM. The new physical constraints require that the CDDF-ROM operators satisfy the same type of physical laws (i.e., the nonlinear operator should conserve energy and the ROM closure term should be dissipative) as those satisfied by the fluid flow equations. To implement these physical constraints, in the data-driven modeling step of the DDF-ROM, we replace the unconstrained least squares problem with a constrained least squares problem. We perform a numerical investigation of the new CDDF-ROM and standard DDF-ROM for a 2D channel flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers {\$}Re=100, Re=500{\$} and {\$}Re=1000{\$}. To this end, we consider a reproductive regime as well as a predictive (i.e., cross-validation) regime in which we use as little as {\$}50\backslash{\%}{\$} of the original training data. The numerical investigation clearly shows that the new CDDF-ROM is significantly more accurate than the DDF-ROM in both regimes.},

The algorithm is trained on several flow cases using DNS/LES data, and used to predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor on multiple test flow cases. Predictions are then propagated with a custom OpenFOAM solver to yield an improved flow field. Results show that the TBRF algorithm is able to accurately predict the anisotropy tensor for various flow cases, with most of the predictions being realizable and close to the DNS/LES reference data. Resulting mean flows for a square duct and a backward facing step show great resemblance to corresponding DNS and experimental data-sets.},

abstract = {This thesis describes the different steps needed to design a steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind farm wake model. The ultimate goal of the project was to design a tool that could analyze and extrapolate systematically wind farm measurements to generate wind maps in order to calibrate faster and simpler engineering wind farm wake models. The most attractive solution was the actuator disc method with the steady state k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model. The first step to design such a tool is the treatment of the forces. This thesis presents a computationally inexpensivemethod to apply discrete body forces into the finite-volume flow solver with collocated variable treatment (EllipSys), which avoids the pressure-velocity decoupling issue. The second step is to distribute the body forces in the computational domain accordingly to rotor loading. This thesis presents a generic flexible method that associates any kind of shapes with the computational domain discretization. The special case of the actuator disc performs remarkably well in comparison with Conways heavily loaded actuator disc analytical solution and a CFD full rotor computation, even with a coarse discretization. The third step is to model the atmospheric turbulence. The standard k-$\epsilon$ model is found to be unable to model at the same time the atmospheric turbulence and the actuator disc wake and performs badly in comparison with single wind turbine wake measurements. A comparison with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) shows that the problem mainly comes from the assumptions of the eddy-viscosity concept, which are deeply invalidated in the wind turbine wake region. Different models that intent to correct the k-$\epsilon$ models issues are investigated, of which none of them is found to be adequate. The mixing of the wake in the atmosphere is a deeply non-local phenomenon that is not handled correctly by an eddy-viscosity model such as k-$\epsilon$ .},

abstract = {Wind turbines in a wind farm, influence each other through the wind flow. Downwind turbines are in the wake of upwind turbines and the wind speed experienced at downwind turbines is hence a function of the wind speeds at upwind turbines but also the momentum extracted from the wind by the upwind turbine. This paper establishes flow models relating the wind speeds at turbines in a farm. So far, research in this area has been mainly based on first principles static models and the data driven modelling done has not included the loading of the upwind turbine and its impact on the wind speed downwind. This paper is the first where modern commercial mega watt turbines are used for data driven modelling including the upwind turbine loading by changing power reference. Obtaining the necessary data is difficult and data is therefore limited. A simple dynamic extension to the Jensen wake model is tested without much success. The best model turns out to be non linear with upwind turbine loading and wind speed as inputs. Using a transformation of these inputs it is possible to obtain a linear model and use well proven system identification methods. Finally it is shown that including the upwind wind direction to explain the wake improve the prediction performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFAC.},

This paper compares five methods, including quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature, polynomial chaos with coefficients determined by sparse quadrature and gradient-enhanced version of kriging, radial basis functions and point collocation polynomial chaos, in their efficiency in estimating statistics of aerodynamic performance upon random perturbation to the airfoil geometry which is parameterized by 9 independent Gaussian variables.

@article{Franklin2007,
abstract = {The best is the cheapest. —Benjamin Franklin 3.1 Introduction In Chapter 2, approximations were considered consisting of expansions around a specific value of the variable (finite or infinite); both convergent and divergent series were described. These are the preferred approaches when values around these points (either in R or C) are needed. In this chapter, approximations in real intervals are considered. The idea is to approx-imate a function f(x) by a polynomial p(x) that gives a uniform and accurate description in an interval [a, b]. Let us denote by P n the set of polynomials of degree at most n and let g be a bounded function defined on [a, b]. Then the uniform norm ||g|| on [a, b] is given by ||g|| = max x∈[a,b] |g(x)|. (3.1) For approximating a continuous function f on an interval [a, b], it is reasonable to consider that the best option consists in finding the minimax approximation, defined as follows. Definition 3.1. q ∈ P n is the best (or minimax) polynomial approximation to f on [a, b] if ||f − q|| ≤ ||f − p|| ∀p ∈ P n . (3.2) Minimax polynomial approximations exist and are unique (see [152]) when f is continuous, although they are not easy to compute in general. Instead, it is a more effective approach to consider near-minimax approximations, based on Chebyshev polynomials. Chebyshev polynomials form a special class of polynomials especially suited for approximating other functions. They are widely used in many areas of numerical analysis: uniform approximation, least-squares approximation, numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations (the so-called spectral or pseudospectral methods), and so on. In this chapter we describe the approximation of continuous functions by Chebyshev interpolation and Chebyshev series and how to compute efficiently such approximations. For the case of functions which are solutions of linear ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients (a typical case for special functions), the problem of computing Chebyshev series is efficiently solved by means of Clenshaw's method, which is also pre-sented in this chapter. Before this, we give a very concise overview of well-known results in interpola-tion theory, followed by a brief summary of important properties satisfied by Chebyshev polynomials. 3.2 Basic results on interpolation},

abstract = {Newton-Cotes quadrature rules are based on polynomial interpolation in a set of equidistant points. They are very useful in applications where sampled function values are only available on a regular grid. Yet, these rules rapidly become unstable for high orders. In this paper we review two techniques to construct stable high-order quadrature rules using equidistant quadrature points. The stability follows from the fact that all coefficients are positive. This result can be achieved by allowing the number of quadrature points to be larger than the polynomial order of accuracy. The computed approximations then implicitly correspond to the integral of a least squares approximation of the integrand. We show how the underlying discrete least squares approximation can be optimised for the purpose of numerical integration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By reduction consistency we refer to the property that if only a set of M (1⩽M⩽N−1) fluids are present in the system then the N-phase governing equations and boundary conditions will exactly reduce to those for the corresponding M-phase system. By thermodynamic consistency we refer to the property that the formulation honors the thermodynamic principles. Our N-phase formulation is developed based on a more general method that allows for the systematic construction of reduction-consistent formulations, and the method suggests the existence of many possible forms of reduction-consistent and thermodynamically consistent N-phase formulations. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for flow problems involving multiple fluid components and large density ratios and large viscosity ratios, and the simulation results are compared with the physical theories or the available physical solutions. The comparisons demonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results for this class of problems.},

@article{Trefethen2011a,
abstract = {It is a pleasure to offer this essay for Mathematics Today as a record of my Summer Lecture on 29 June 2011 at the Royal Society. Polynomials are as basic a topic as any in mathematics, and for numerical mathematicians like me, they are the starting point of numerical methods that in some cases go back centuries, like quadrature formulae for numerical integration and Newton itera-tions for finding roots. You would think that by now, the basic facts about computing with polynomials would be widely under-stood. In fact, the situation is almost the reverse. There are indeed widespread views about polynomials, but some of the important ones are wrong, founded on misconceptions entrenched by gener-ations of textbooks. Since 2006, my colleagues and I have been solving mathemat-ical problems with polynomials using the Chebfun software sys-tem (www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun). We have learned from daily experience how fast and reliable polynomials are. This en-tirely positive record has made me curious to try to pin down where these misconceptions come from, and this essay is an at-tempt to summarise some of my findings. Full details, including precise definitions and theorems, can be found in my draft book Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice, available at www.maths.ox.ac.uk/{\~{}}trefethen. The essay is organised around 'six myths'. Each myth has some truth in it – mathematicians rarely say things that are simply false! Yet each one misses something important. Throughout the discussion, f is a continuous function defined on the interval [−1, 1], n + 1 distinct points x 0 , . . . , x n in [−1, 1] are given, and p n is the unique polynomial of degree at most n with p n (x j) = f (x j) for each j. Two families of points will be of partic-ular interest: equispaced points, x j = −1 + 2j/n, and Chebyshev points, x j = cos(j$\pi$/n). I will also mention Legendre points, de-fined as the zeros of the degree n + 1 Legendre polynomial P n+1 . The discussion of each myth begins with two or three represen-tative quotations from leading textbooks, listed anonymously with the year of publication. Then I say a word about the mathematical truth underlying the myth, and after that, what that truth overlooks. Myth 1. Polynomial interpolants diverge as n → ∞ Textbooks regularly warn students not to expect p n → f as n → ∞. 'Polynomial interpolants rarely converge to a general continuous function.' (1989) 'Unfortunately, there are functions for which inter-polation at the Chebyshev points fails to converge.' (1996) On the face of it, this caution is justified by two theorems. Weierstrass proved in 1885 [1] that any continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by polynomials. On the other hand, Faber proved in 1914 [2] that no polynomial interpolation scheme, no matter how the points are distributed, will converge for all such functions. So it sounds as if there is something wrong with polynomial in-terpolation. Yet the truth is, polynomial interpolants in Chebyshev points always converge if f is a little bit smooth. (We shall call them Chebyshev interpolants.) Lipschitz continuity is more than enough, that is, |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ L|x − y| for some constant L and all x, y ∈ [−1, 1]. So long as f is Lipschitz continuous, as it will be in almost any practical application, p n → f is guaranteed. There is indeed a big problem with convergence of polynomial interpolants, but it pertains to interpolation in equispaced points. As Runge showed in 1901 [3], equispaced interpolants may diverge exponentially, even if f is so smooth as to be analytic (holomor-phic). This genuinely important fact, known as the Runge phe-nomenon, has confused people. With Faber's theorem seeming to provide justification, a real problem with equispaced polynomial interpolants has been overgeneralised so that people have suspected it of applying to polynomial interpolants in general. The smoother f is, the faster its Chebyshev interpolants con-verge. If f has $\nu$ derivatives, with the $\nu$ th derivative being of bounded variation V , then − p n = O(V n −$\nu$) as n → ∞. (By − p n I mean the maximum of |f (x) − p n (x)| for x ∈ [−1, 1].) If f is analytic, the convergence is geometric, with − p n = O($\rho$ −n) for some $\rho$ {\textgreater} 1. I will give details about the parameter $\rho$ under Myth 5. For example, here is the degree 10,000 Chebyshev interpolant p n to the sawtooth function f (x) defined as the integral from −1 to x of sign(sin(100t/(2 − t))). This curve may not look like a polynomial, but it is! With − p n ≈ 0.0001, the plot is indis-tinguishable from a plot of f itself. 1885 that any continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by poly-nomials. On the other hand, Faber proved in 1914 that no polynomial interpolation scheme, no matter how the points are distributed, will converge for all such functions. So it sounds as if there is something wrong with polynomial interpolation. Yet the truth is, polynomial interpolants in Chebyshev points always converge if f is a little bit smooth (we shall call them Chebyshev interpolants).

The dynamic Bayesian network integrates physics models and various aleatory (random) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty sources in crack growth prediction. In diagnosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used to track the evolution of the time-dependent variables and calibrate the time-independent variables; in prognosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used for probabilistic prediction of crack growth in the future.

abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. They are both examples of "functional data", which have become a prevailing type of data. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool and in sparse data situations can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single or multiple index methods we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models, such as time warping, manifold learning, and dynamic modeling with empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

abstract = {We propose a strategy to design locally conservative finite-difference approximations of convective derivatives for shock-free compressible flows with arbitrary order of accuracy, that generalizes the approach of Ducros et al. (2000) [1], and that can be applied as a building block of low-dissipative, hybrid shock-capturing methods. The approximations stem from application of standard central difference formulas to split forms of the convective terms in the compressible Euler equations, which guarantee strong numerical stability and (near) energy preservation in the inviscid limit. A convenient implementation of the high-order fluxes is suggested, which guarantees improved computational efficiency over existing methods. Numerical tests performed for isotropic turbulence at zero viscosity show stability of schemes with order of accuracy up to ten, and effectiveness of convective splitting of Kennedy and Gruber (2008) [2] in providing extra stability in the presence of strong density variations. Numerical simulations of compressible turbulent boundary layer flow indicate suitability of the method for non-uniform grids, and overall support superior computational efficiency of high-order schemes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In modern engineering, physical processes are modelled and analysed using advanced computer simulations, such as finite element models. Furthermore, concepts of reliability analysis and robust design are becoming popular, hence, making efficient quantification and propagation of uncertainties an important aspect. In this context, a typical workflow includes the characterization of the uncertainty in the input variables. In this paper, input variables are modelled by probability-boxes (p-boxes), accounting for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. The propagation of p-boxes leads to p-boxes of the output of the computational model. A two-level meta-modelling approach is proposed using non-intrusive sparse polynomial chaos expansions to surrogate the exact computational model and, hence, to facilitate the uncertainty quantification analysis. The capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated through applications using a benchmark analytical function and two realistic engineering problem settings. They show that the proposed two-level approach allows for an accurate estimation of the statistics of the response quantity of interest using a small number of evaluations of the exact computational model. This is crucial in cases where the computational costs are dominated by the runs of high-fidelity computational models.},

Second, an analysis of the modes of the numerical scheme is conducted, which explains under which circumstances boundary layers persist over many time steps. Third, a new condition on the Butcher tableau, called weak stage order, is provided that can recover the full order, and that is compatible with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes. And fourth, modified boundary conditions are derived that remedy the order reduction phenomenon.},

This paper explores different numerical strategies for the subproblems and suggests an optimal combination for the MLMC estimator. We propose a specific monolithic multigrid algorithm to efficiently solve the steady-state Darcy–Stokes flow with a highly heterogeneous diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we describe an Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) based time-stepping for the flux-limited quadratic upwinding discretization for the transport problem.

@article{Grant2018,
abstract = {High order strong stability preserving (SSP) time discretizations are often needed to ensure the nonlinear non- inner-product strong stability properties of spatial discretizations specially designed for the solution of hyperbolic PDEs. Multiderivative time-stepping methods have recently been increasingly used for evolving hyperbolic PDEs, and the strong stability properties of these methods are of new interest. In our prior work we explored time discretizations that preserve the strong stability properties of spatial discretizations coupled with forward Euler and a second derivative formulation. However, many spatial discretizations do not satisfy strong stability properties when coupled with this second derivative formulation, but rather with a more natural Taylor series formulation. In this work we demonstrate sufficient conditions for a two-derivative multistage method to preserve the strong stability properties of spatial discretizations in a forward Euler and Taylor series formulation. We call these strong stability preserving (SSP) Taylor series (TS) methods. We also prove that the maximal order of SSP TS methods is p = 6, and define an optimization procedure that allows us to find such SSP methods. Several types of these methods are presented and their efficiency compared. Finally, These methods are tested on several PDEs to demonstrate the benefit of these SSP TS methods, the need for the SSP property, and the sharpness of the SSP time-step in many cases.},

A direct use of Monte Carlo simulation is not feasible in practice, unless a surrogate model (such as kriging, also known as Gaussian process modeling) is used. Such metamodels are often used in conjunction with adaptive experimental designs (i.e., design enrichment strategies), which allows one to iteratively increase the accuracy of the surrogate for the estimation of the failure probability while keeping low the overall number of runs of the costly original model.

abstract = {Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the computational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning models have opened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of RANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several data-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the uncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification for such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability rapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in the training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that not only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for fluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture include both model form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited training data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the anisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained using Stein's variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on the Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla Monte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ geometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers. The prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the associated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately this framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and uncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or prior knowledge is available.},

abstract = {The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the main concepts associated to the Industry 4.0 wave. This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors. The paper also proposes the definition of DT for Industry 4.0 manufacturing, elaborated by the European H2020 project MAYA, as a contribution to the research discussion about DT concept.},

abstract = {In this work, we consider the discretization of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) based on collocation of quadrature and interpolation points (Kopriva and Gassner, J. Sci. Comput., 44 (2010), pp.136--155; Carpenter et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 36 (2014), pp.{\~{}}B835-B867). We present a general framework for the design of such schemes that satisfy a semi-discrete entropy inequality for a given convex entropy function at any approximation order. The framework is closely related to the one introduced for conservation laws by Chen and Shu (J. Comput. Phys., 345 (2017), pp.{\~{}}427--461) and relies on the modification of the integral over discretization elements where we replace the physical fluxes by entropy conservative numerical fluxes from Castro et al. (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp.{\~{}}1371--1391), while entropy stable numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. Time discretization is performed with strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes. We use this framework for the discretization of two systems in one space-dimension: a {\$}2\backslashtimes2{\$} system with a nonconservative product associated to a linearly-degenerate field for which the DGSEM fails to capture the physically relevant solution, and the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model. For the latter, we derive conditions on the numerical parameters of the discrete scheme to further keep positivity of the partial densities and a maximum principle on the void fractions. Numerical experiments support the conclusions of the present analysis and highlight stability and robustness of the present schemes.},

The model consists of equations for the conservation of mass for each of the phases and the conservation of momentum of the mixture. In addition, an equation – the so-called gas slip relation – is supplied which relates the velocities of the two phases at any point. We present and demonstrate high-resolution hybrid primitive–conservative upwind schemes, which utilize a simple non-conservative MUSCL scheme in shock free flow regions and high-resolution conservative upwind schemes in shocked flow regions. We apply these hybrid schemes to various test problems and compare them with some conservative upwind schemes. The overall conclusion is that the hybrid upwind schemes are as accurate as the corresponding conservative schemes. The hybrid schemes are, however, more efficient.},

Particular emphasis is placed on those aspects of pipeline design that bear a direct relevance to the final levelized cost of transmission. The conventionally held belief that hydrogen can only be transmitted over relatively short distances (because of its low volumetric energy content) is challenged by results indicating that under certain conditions (mainly high production pressures and large enough markets), it may be economically feasible to transport hydrogen or hydrogen-natural gas mixtures over long distances. Attention is also given to the option of transmitting hydrogen through existing natural gas pipeline networks. It is shown that inefficiencies introduced due to the use of existing systems can be overlooked because of the large reduction in transmission costs brought about by the potential to produce hydrogen at elevated pressures. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

This is relevant not only for events like start-up, shutdown or planned or uncontrolled depressurization of pipelines, but also for normal operation, and therefore needs to be taken into account by simulation tools employed for design and operation of CO2pipelines. During transportation, CO2will often be in a dense liquid phase, whereas e.g. natural gas is in a dense gaseous phase. This requires special attention to depressurization and the possible propagation of cracks. In addition, we highlight and illustrate research challenges related to thermodynamics, and the modelling of the wave-propagation velocity (speed of sound) for two-phase flows. Further, some relevant currently available simulation tools, and their applicability to CO2transport, are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The level-set method is a popular interface tracking method in two-phase flow simulations. An often-cited reason for using it is that the method naturally handles topological changes in the interface, e.g. merging drops, due to the implicit formulation. It is also said that the interface curvature and normal vectors are easily calculated. This last point is not, however, the case in the moments during a topological change, as several authors have already pointed out. Various methods have been employed to circumvent the problem. In this paper, we present a new such method which retains the implicit level-set representation of the surface and handles general interface configurations. It is demonstrated that the method extends easily to 3D. The method is validated on static interface configurations, and then applied to two-phase flow simulations where the method outperforms the standard method and the results agree well with experiments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.},

abstract = {This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While the book gives many examples of the usefulness of the methods for a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems.  The book begins with the description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, and then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, reinitialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method, and the motion of codimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the field of image processing and computer vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to computational physics. It begins with one-phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke; free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water; and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change it's topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.},

abstract = {Modern scientific computational methods are undergoing a transformative change; big data and statistical learning methods now have the potential to outperform the classical first-principles modeling paradigm. This book bridges this transition, connecting the theory of probability, stochastic processes, functional analysis, numerical analysis, and differential geometry. It describes two classes of computational methods to leverage data for modeling dynamical systems. The first is concerned with data fitting algorithms to estimate parameters in parametric models that are postulated on the basis of physical or dynamical laws. The second class is on operator estimation, which uses the data to nonparametrically approximate the operator generated by the transition function of the underlying dynamical systems. This self-contained book is suitable for graduate studies in applied mathematics, statistics, and engineering. Carefully chosen elementary examples with supplementary MATLAB codes and appendices covering the relevant prerequisite materials are provided, making it suitable for self-study.},

The new closure relations are formulated in terms of the single-phase-based expressions, which are augmented by the two-phase interaction factors. The two-fluid model is tested against the exact solution of fully developed laminar pipe flow with a flat and smooth interface. The predictions of the two-fluid model for the pressure gradient and holdup favorably compare with those obtained by the exact solution for a wide range of dimensionless parameters in co-current and counter-current laminar flows. The two-fluid model is also capable of handling the change in the direction of the wall shear-stress when gravity driven backflow in either of the phases is encountered. Additionally, it also correctly predicts the multiple holdups and the operational conditions for their possible occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effects of inclination on the characteristics of laminar countercurrent liquid-liquid flow are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results show that with a slight off-vertical inclination the phases tend to segregate and the basic flow pattern in inclined tubes is stratified flow. Moreover, for fixed operational conditions, there exist two stable modes of stratified configuration that differ in the in situ holdup, velocity profiles and the pressure drop, and both may co-exist in the column. The application of the two-fluid and the two-plate models for the prediction of the characteristics of countercurrent flow is explored. Both models predict the existence of the two modes that have been observed in the column and their associated holdups. The TP model confirms the experimental finding that back flow (opposite to the feed direction) is an inherent characteristic of countercurrent flow and generally, is expected in the thicker layer. The findings of this study are applicable for improving the throughput of phase transition extraction columns. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We propose and analyze a multilevel version of the stochastic collocation method that, as is the case for multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods, uses hierarchies of spatial approximations to reduce the overall computational complexity. In addition, our proposed approach utilizes, for approximation in stochastic space, a sequence of multi-dimensional interpolants of increasing fidelity which can then be used for approximating statistics of the solution as well as for building high-order surrogates featuring faster convergence rates. A rigorous convergence and computational cost analysis of the new multilevel stochastic collocation method is provided, demonstrating its advantages compared to standard single-level stochastic collocation approximations as well as MLMC methods. Numerical results are provided that illustrate the theory and the effectiveness of the new multilevel method.},

The introduction of the multi-holdup regions on flow-pattern maps of various gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems, indicates that these regions correspond to operational conditions where stratified flow was experimentally observed.

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of investigations on liquid-liquid flow through horizontal pipes. Characteristics like flow pattern, pattern transition including phase-inversion, pressure gradient across the flow, effective viscosity and heat transfer are discussed. Developments through experimental investigations and the analytical model formulations on these phenomena are presented. Various methodologies, in the literature, to characterize the flow pattern maps of immiscible liquid-liquid flow, like the customary superficial (volume) velocity (Q/A), superficial (mass) velocity/mass-flux (m/A) and non-dimensional parameter (Rem/Eo) are also discussed. An analysis of experimental data from literature to study the flow pattern using momentum of the fluid phases is performed. It is noted that the flow pattern characterization using mass-flux or momentum of the fluid phase(s) is more discerning than by using superficial (volume) velocity. The analysis also indicates that, irrespective of the flow pattern, the fluid phase with higher momentum behaves as dominant fluid phase of the flow system. In summary, the review of the literature on liquid-liquid horizontal pipe flow reveals: (i) a standard methodology to describe and distinguish flow patterns and its transition is required to be developed; (ii) classification of flow patterns using momentum based parameter would facilitate in defining the dominant fluid phase of the system rather than customarily used superficial (volume based) velocity; (iii) asymmetry during phase-inversion observed in the literature do not exist when data is analyzed using mass-velocities; (iv) Reynolds stress of the fluid phases indicates that the denser phase turbulence gets delayed due to the oil phase and this phenomenon needs investigation. This would further facilitate comprehension of the interfacial interactions of the fluid phases; (v) investigation of evolution of large-scale coherent fluid structures and its interfacial interactions would also make possible in developing appropriate closure relations required for enhanced compatibility of models and experimental data; (vi) currently available empirical convective heat transfer relations do not corroborate with the experimental data. Further research is required to develop improved two-phase convective heat transfer models.},

abstract = {Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions are widely used in various engineering fields for quantifying uncertainties arising from uncertain parameters. The computational cost of classical PC solution schemes is unaffordable as the number of deterministic simulations to be calculated grows dramatically with the number of stochastic dimension. This considerably restricts the practical use of PC at the industrial level. A common approach to address such problems is to make use of sparse PC expansions. This paper presents a non-intrusive regression-based method for building sparse PC expansions. The most important PC contributions are detected sequentially through an automatic search procedure. The variable selection criterion is based on efficient tools relevant to probabilistic method. Two benchmark analytical functions are used to validate the proposed algorithm. The computational efficiency of the method is then illustrated by a more realistic CFD application, consisting of the non-deterministic flow around a transonic airfoil subject to geometrical uncertainties. To assess the performance of the developed methodology, a detailed comparison is made with the well established LAR-based selection technique. The results show that the developed sparse regression technique is able to identify the most significant PC contributions describing the problem. Moreover, the most important stochastic features are captured at a reduced computational cost compared to the LAR method. The results also demonstrate the superior robustness of the method by repeating the analyses using random experimental designs.},

abstract = {Implicit/explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes are effective for time-marching ODE systems with both stiff and nonstiff terms on the RHS; such schemes implement an (often A-stable or better) implicit RK scheme for the stiff part of the ODE, which is often linear, and, simultaneously, a (more convenient) explicit RK scheme for the nonstiff part of the ODE, which is often nonlinear. Low-storage RK schemes are especially effective for time-marching high-dimensional ODE discretizations of PDE systems on modern (cache-based) computational hardware, in which memory management is often the most significant computational bottleneck. In this paper, we develop and characterize eight new low-storage implicit/explicit RK schemes which have higher accuracy and better stability properties than the only low-storage implicit/explicit RK scheme available previously, the venerable second-order Crank-Nicolson/Runge-Kutta-Wray (CN/RKW3) algorithm that has dominated the DNS/LES literature for the last 25 years, while requiring similar storage (two, three, or four registers of length N) and comparable floating-point operations per timestep.},

abstract = {Operator transformations are presented that allow matrix operators for collocated variables to be transformed into matrix operators for staggered variables while preserving symmetries. These "shift" transformations permit conservative, skew-symmetric convective operators and symmetric, positive-definite diffusive operators to be obtained for staggered variables using collocated operators. Shift transformations are not limited to uniform or structured meshes, and this formulation leads to a generalization of the works of Perot (J. Comput. Phys. 159 (2000) 58) and Verstappen and Veldman (J. Comput. Phys. 187 (2003) 343). A set of shift operators have been developed for, and applied to, a time-adaptive Cartesian mesh method with a fractional step algorithm. The resulting numerical scheme conserves mass to machine error and conserves momentum and energy to second order in time. A mass conserving interpolation is used for the variables during mesh adaptation; the interpolation conserves momentum and energy to second order in space. Turbulent channel flow simulations were conducted at Re$\tau$≈ 180 using direct numerical simulation (DNS). The DNS results from the adaptive method compare favourably with spectral DNS results despite the use of a (formally) second-order accurate scheme. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient numerical method for evaluating rare failure probability. The method is based on a recently developed surrogate-based method from Li and Xiu [J. Li, D. Xiu, Evaluation of failure probability via surrogate models, J. Comput. Phys. 229 (2010) 8966-8980] for failure probability computation. The method by Li and Xiu is of hybrid nature, in the sense that samples of both the surrogate model and the true physical model are used, and its efficiency gain relies on using only very few samples of the true model. Here we extend the capability of the method to rare probability computation by using the idea of importance sampling (IS). In particular, we employ cross-entropy (CE) method, which is an effective method to determine the biasing distribution in IS. We demonstrate that, by combining with the CE method, a surrogate-based IS algorithm can be constructed and is highly efficient for rare failure probability computation-it incurs much reduced simulation efforts compared to the traditional CE-IS method. In many cases, the new method is capable of capturing failure probability as small as 10-12{\~{}}10-6with only several hundreds samples. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Traditional sampling methods, such as Monte Carlo, Latin hypercube, quasi-Monte Carlo, optimal design of experiments (ODE), Gaussian quadratures, as well as more recent techniques, such as coherence-optimal and randomized quadratures are discussed. We also propose a hybrid sampling method, dubbed alphabetic-coherence-optimal, that employs the so-called alphabetic optimality criteria used in the context of ODE in conjunction with coherence-optimal samples. A comparison between the empirical performance of the selected sampling methods applied to three numerical examples, including high-order PCE's, high-dimensional problems, and low oversampling ratios, is presented to provide a road map for practitioners seeking the most suitable sampling technique for a problem at hand. We observed that the alphabetic-coherence-optimal technique outperforms other sampling methods, specially when high-order ODE are employed and/or the oversampling ratio is low.},

abstract = {Polynomial surrogates are used to characterize the energy production and lifetime equivalent fatigue loads for different components of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine under realistic atmospheric conditions. The variability caused by different turbulent inflow fields are captured by creating independent surrogates for the mean and standard deviation of each output with respect to the inflow realizations. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the turbulent inflow realization has a bigger impact on the total distribution of equivalent fatigue loads than the shear coefficient or yaw miss-alignment. The methodology presented extends the deterministic power and thrust coefficient curves to uncertainty models and adds new variables like damage equivalent fatigue loads in different components of the turbine. These surrogate models can then be implemented inside other work-flows such as: estimation of the uncertainty in annual energy production due to wind resource variability and/or robust wind power plant layout optimization. It can be concluded that it is possible to capture the global behavior of a modern wind turbine and its uncertainty under realistic inflow conditions using polynomial response surfaces. The surrogates are a way to obtain power and load estimation under site specific characteristics without sharing the proprietary aeroelastic design.},

Currently, several floating turbine concepts are being designed and tested in small scale projects; in particular, one concept allows the turbine to move after installation. This article presents a novel layout optimization framework for wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines. The proposed framework uses an evolutionary optimization strategy in a nested configuration which simultaneously optimizes the anchoring locations and the wind turbine position within the mooring lines for each individual wind direction. The results show that maximum energy production is obtained when moveable wind turbines are deployed in an optimized layout. In conclusion, the framework represents a new design optimization tool for future offshore wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines.},

abstract = {A systematic analysis of the discrete conservation properties of non-dissipative, central-difference approximations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is reported. A general triple splitting of the nonlinear convective terms is considered, and energy-preserving formulations are fully characterized by deriving a two-parameter family of split forms. Previously developed formulations reported in literature are shown to be particular members of this family; novel splittings are introduced and discussed as well. Furthermore, the conservation properties yielded by different choices for the energy equation (i.e. total and internal energy, entropy) are analyzed thoroughly. It is shown that additional preserved quantities can be obtained through a suitable adaptive selection of the split form within the derived family. Local conservation of primary invariants, which is a fundamental property to build high-fidelity shock-capturing methods, is also discussed in the paper. Numerical tests performed for the Taylor-Green Vortex at zero viscosity fully confirm the theoretical findings, and show that a careful choice of both the splitting and the energy formulation can provide remarkably robust and accurate results.},

abstract = {AbstractPrediction of the critical flow rate that will result in sand bed formation in multiphase flow is a critical aspect of multiphase production. Many correlations have been developed for solids transportation in multiphase flow; however, all of them treat the multiphase flow in an ad hoc way that does not respect the complexity of the phenomenon. Further, many approaches rely on correlations that have been developed for much higher solids loading than would occur in oil and gas production. In this paper, first a correlation for liquid-solid transport is developed, based on data taken in the SINTEF STRONG JIP. A good fit to both sand bed height and measured pressure drop is obtained. A critical aspect of the model is the assumption that there is a critical slip velocity between the sand and liquid which remains relatively constant over a wide range of flow velocities. Second, the particle diameter is used to augment the surface roughness. A critical velocity correlation is developed, based on solid and fluid properties, and pipe diameter. An essential feature of the model is that the critical slip between the liquid and solid phases is unaffected by the presence of gas. Good fit to the data is obtained. A sand model is developed using OLGA2000 which does a good job in fitting sand hold-up against the experimental data. Such a model can be used to predict sand bed formation potential in field lines. IntroductionSand is often produced out of the reservoir in both onshore and offshore production systems, particularly in reservoirs that have a low formation strength. Sand production may be continuous, or sudden - as when a gravel pack fails. In the case that no downhole sand control is done, or that a sandcontainment strategy fails, a sand-management strategy must be employed, with operations designed to tolerate a certain amount of sand production. Deposition of sand beds poses several risks, including increased frictional pressure losses, increased risk of corrosion due to microbial attack under the sand bed, and increased risk of equipment failure due to sand. Sand transport in near-horizontal pipelines has four main regimes, depending on the fluid flow rate. Below a critical velocity, sand will drop out of the carrier fluid and form a stable, stationary sand bed. As the sand bed builds over time, the fluid above the bed is forced into a smaller cross-sectional area, causing the fluid velocity to increase. When the velocity reaches a critical value, sand is transported in a thin layer along the top of the sand bed. A steady-state is reached, such that the sand eroded from the top of the bed is replaced by new sand production from upstream. At higher velocities, the sand bed begins to break up into a series of slow-moving dunes, with sand particles transported from the upstream to the downstream side of the dune. As the flow velocity increases still further, the dunes break up entirely, and the sand forms a moving bed along the bottom of the pipe.},

@article{Danielson2012a,
abstract = {Historically, transient multiphase flow codes grew out of nuclear safety codes developed specifically to model nuclear plants during loss-of-coolant accidents (i.e., steam–water). These codes were heavily augmented by the oil and gas industry to deal with the more complex fluids, geometries, and thermodynamics associated with oil and gas production. Although several attempts were made to develop transient mixture models with a single momentum equation, development settled on two-fluid formulations, employing separate momentum equations for each phase (developed out of a force balance), as the best way forward. While such models were quite successful in simulating holdup and pressure drop during both steady-state and transient operations, many associated flow assurance issues (i.e., hydrates and hydrodynamic slugs) remain quite rudimentary. Also, the simulators themselves are terrifically slow by general computational fluid dynamics (CFD) standards. In the future, simple, powerful mixture models may well make a comeback, supplanting the more complex two-fluid models. The rationale is 3-fold: First, the simplicity of these models will allow for much greater computational speed, resulting in the possibility to run much finer grids (on the order of a pipeline diameter) than currently used by transient pipeline simulators. Second, compositional tracking could be routinely used, allowing for much simpler simulations of, for example, complex networks of differing fluids. Third, flow assurance phenomena, such as hydrate formation, could be folded directly into the multiphase model on a fundamental level rather than as an ad hoc addition.},

abstract = {This paper examines the minimum flow rates of gas and liquid necessary to keep particles moving in a horizontal flow line with emphasis on flows with high gas-liquid ratios resulting in stratified wavy flow with small liquid hold-up. Experimental results are presented for flows in 0.05m and 0.1m diameter pipes varying particle size and shape. The types of particles used are sand and glass beads. Additionally, experiments are performed for two particle volume concentrations: 0.01 and 0.1 volume percent. Varying these physical parameters, the effects of particle concentration, particle shape, particle size and pipe size are experimentally investigated in this study. Finally, available models in the literature to predict sand transport critical velocity in multiphase flows is examined using the experimental data obtained in this study. The comparison shows none of the available models can predict critical velocity accurately in the stratified wavy flow regime at very small liquid hold-up.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are designed using the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-1 standard,1 which prescribes a set of simulations to ascertain the ultimate and fatigue loads that the turbine could encounter under a variety of environmental and operational conditions. In the simulation prescription, the only probabilistic variable considered is the mean hub-height wind speed. Other wind parameters - such as the turbulence spectra, sheer, veer, spatial coherence, and component correlation - are deterministic values that remain constant across all simulations (turbulence and coherence only vary with wind speed). In addition, these values are set based on the IEC classification of the wind turbine and hub height. These other wind parameters, however, could vary vastly in time and between different sites and could potentially have a significant effect on the resulting loads the turbine could see. Therefore, this paper seeks to assess the sensitivity of different wind parameters on the resulting loads of the wind turbine, to (1) rank the sensitivities of different parameters, (2) help establish error bars around the predictions of engineering models during validation efforts, and (3) provide insight to probabilistic design methods and site-suitability analyses.},

abstract = {Sampling orthogonal polynomial bases via Monte Carlo is of interest for uncertainty quantification of models with random inputs, using Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions. It is known that bounding a probabilistic parameter, referred to as coherence, yields a bound on the number of samples necessary to identify coefficients in a sparse PC expansion via solution to an ℓ1-minimization problem. Utilizing results for orthogonal polynomials, we bound the coherence parameter for polynomials of Hermite and Legendre type under their respective natural sampling distribution. In both polynomial bases we identify an importance sampling distribution which yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order of the approximation. For more general orthonormal bases, we propose the coherence-optimal sampling: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, which directly uses the basis functions under consideration to achieve a statistical optimality among all sampling schemes with identical support. We demonstrate these different sampling strategies numerically in both high-order and high-dimensional, manufactured PC expansions. In addition, the quality of each sampling method is compared in the identification of solutions to two differential equations, one with a high-dimensional random input and the other with a high-order PC expansion. In both cases, the coherence-optimal sampling scheme leads to similar or considerably improved accuracy.},

abstract = {A modified version of the projection scheme [19] is proposed, which does not show a lower limit for the time step in contrast to the limits of stability observed numerically for some projection type schemes. An advantage of the proposed scheme is that the right-hand side of the Poisson equation for the pressure is independent of the time step. An explicit version of the current scheme is also provided besides the implicit-explicit one. For the implicit-explicit version, we retain divergence of the viscous terms on the right-hand side of the Poisson equation in order to achieve a higher accuracy for low Reynolds number flows. In this way, we also ensure that the Poisson equation with Neumann boundary condition is consistent on the discrete level, where we discretize the boundary condition as well. The spatial discretization is performed for equal and mixed orders of the velocity and pressure using the dG method. Long-term stability and optimal temporal and spatial convergence rates are obtained for the unsteady Taylor vortex and periodic channel flows. An excellent agreement with the similarity solution is achieved for the steady plane stagnation point flow. Finally, the current projection scheme is compared with the original one for a more complex coupled electro-fluid-dynamics problem. For the same numerical settings, the current scheme appears to be more accurate in predicting the expected physical behavior and it is long-term stable while the original scheme fails.},

abstract = {The possibility of predicting the exact long wave linear stability boundary via the two-fluid (TF) model for horizontal and inclined stratified two-phase flow is examined. The application of the TF model requires the introduction of empirical closure relations for the velocity profile shape factors and for the wave induced wall and interfacial shear stresses. The latter are recognized as the problematic closure laws. In order to explore the closure relations effects and to suggest the necessary modifications that can improve the stability predictions of the TF model, the results are compared with the exact long wave solution of the Orr–Sommerfeld equations for the two-plate geometry. It is demonstrated that with the shape factors corrections and the inclusion of wave induced stresses effects, the TF model is able to fully reproduce the exact long wave neutral stability curves. The wave induced shear stresses in phase with the wave slope, which give rise to the so called “sheltering force”, were found to have a remarkable destabilizing effect in many cases of horizontal and inclined flows. In such cases, the sheltering effects must be included in the TF model, otherwise the region of smooth stratified flow would be significantly over predicted. Based on the results of the exact analysis, a simple closure relation for the sheltering term in the TF model is provided.},

@article{Xiao2016a,
abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering analysis, design and optimization. While the predictive capability of RANS models depends on many factors, for many practical flows the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. As RANS models are used in the design and safety evaluation of many mission-critical systems such as airplanes and nuclear power plants, quantifying their model-form uncertainties has significant implications in enabling risk-informed decision-making. In this work we develop a data-driven, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Both cases are challenging for standard RANS turbulence models. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the obtained posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the models are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many fields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.},

abstract = {This article examines the use of characteristic methods in stratified two-phase pipe flow simulations for obtaining non-dissipative flow predictions. A Roe scheme and several methods based on the principle of characteristics are presented for the two-fluid model. The main focus is finding numerically efficient ways of capturing wave dynamics and flow regime transitions through direct simulation. Capturing flow regime transitions both effciently and precisely necessitates schemes which remain stable in a numerical sense, yet predicts wave growth once the flow conditions turn unstable. Characteristic methods offer the possibility of simulating hyperbolic systems without numerical dissipation. These methods do however lack certain fundamental conservation properties. Challenges related to information scattering and clustering in space and time, particularly around shocks, are also an issue in some method variants. Hybridisations with the finite volume method are proposed which overcome these shortcomings. All methods are compared, evaluating predictions on the onset of linear wave growth and simulations of non-linear, discontinuous roll-waves. The following observations are made: 1. Characteristic methods are excellent at predicting the onset of linear hydrodynamic instability, even with a small number of computational nodes. 2. Dissipative errors in finite volume methods and characteristic hybrids will be closely linked to the CFL number. The Roe scheme and the characteristic hybrids give very little dissipation error as the CFL number approaches unity. This then becomes a question of numerical stability. 3. Adapting dynamic grid cells, moving along with the characteristics information drift, greatly improves simulation efficiency by allowing for longer time steps. Dynamic grid cells are also useful for alleviating the need for interpolation in characteristic methods. On the whole, the performance of the characteristic hybridisations are similar to that of the Roe scheme at large CFL numbers. Characteristic hybridisations perform somewhat better in predicting linear instability while the Roe scheme is better suited for the shock fronts found in the roll-wave flow regime. These method easily out-perform the more basic upwind and Lax–Friedrich schemes.},

abstract = {LES for industrial applications with complex geometries is mostly characterised by: a) a finite volume CFD method using a non-staggered arrangement of the flow variables and second order accurate spatial and temporal discretisation schemes, b) an implicit top-hat filter, where the filter length is equal to the local computational cell size, and c) eddy-viscosity type LES models. LES based on these three main characteristics is indicated as industrial LES in this paper. It becomes increasingly clear that the numerical dissipation in CFD codes typically used in industrial applications with complex geometries may inhibit the predictive capabilities of explicit LES. Therefore, there is a need to quantify the numerical dissipation rate in such CFD codes. In this paper, we quantify the numerical dissipation rate in physical space based on an analysis of the transport equation for the mean turbulent kinetic energy. Using this method, we quantify the numerical dissipation rate in a quasi-Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and in under-resolved DNS of, as a basic demonstration case, fully-developed turbulent channel flow. With quasi-DNS, we indicate a DNS performed using a second order accurate finite volume method typically used in industrial applications. Furthermore, we determine and explain the trends in the performance of industrial LES for fully-developed turbulent channel flow for four different Reynolds numbers for three different LES mesh resolutions. The presented explanation of the mechanisms behind the observed trends is based on an analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy budgets. The presented quantitative analyses demonstrate that the numerical errors in the industrial LES computations of the considered turbulent channel flows result in a net numerical dissipation rate which is larger than the subgrid-scale dissipation rate. No new computational methods are presented in this paper. Instead, the main new elements in this paper are our detailed quantification method for the numerical dissipation rate, the application of this method to a quasi-DNS and under-resolved DNS of fully-developed turbulent channel flow, and the explanation of the effects of the numerical dissipation on the observed trends in the performance of industrial LES for fully-developed turbulent channel flows.},

abstract = {We will look at the Gaussian distribution from a Bayesian point of view. In the standard form, the likelihood has two parameters, the mean µ and the variance $\sigma$ 2 : P (x 1 , x 2 , {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} , x n | µ, $\sigma$ 2) ∝ 1 $\sigma$ n exp − 1 2$\sigma$ 2 (x i − µ) 2 (1) Our aim is to find conjugate prior distributions for these parameters. We will investigate the hyper-parameter (prior parameter) update relations and the problem of predicting new data from old data: P (x new | x old). 1 Fixed variance ($\sigma$ 2), random mean (µ) Keeping $\sigma$ 2 fixed, the conjugate prior for µ is a Gaussian. P (µ | µ 0 , $\sigma$ 2 0) ∝ 1 $\sigma$ 0 exp − 1 2$\sigma$ 2 0 (µ − µ 0) 2 (2) typically 0 typically large Remark 1. In practice, when little is known about µ, it is common to set the location hyper-parameter to zero and the scale to some large value. 1.1 Posterior for single measurement (n = 1) We want to put together the prior (2) and the likelihood (1) to get the posterior (µ | x). For now, assume we have only one measurement (n = 1); There are several ways to do this: • We could multiply the two distributions directly and complete the square in the exponent. • Note that µ and x have a joint Gaussian distribution. Then the conditional µ | x is also a Gaussian for whose parameters we know formulas: Lemma 2. Assume (z 1 , z 2) is distributed according to a bivariate Gaussian. Then z 1 | z 2 is Gaussian dis-tributed with parameters: E(z 1 | z 2) = E(z 1) + Cov(z 1 , z 2) Var(z 2) (z 2 − E(z 2)) (3) Var(z 1 | z 2) = Var(z 1) − Cov 2 (z 1 , z 2) Var(z 2) (4) 1},

@article{Felten2006,
abstract = {The collocated-mesh scheme is often favored over the staggered-mesh scheme for turbulence simulation in complex geometries due to its simpler form in curvilinear coordinates. The collocated mesh scheme does not conserve kinetic energy however, and few careful checks of the impact of these errors have been made. In this work, analysis is used to identify two sources of kinetic energy conservation error in the collocated-mesh scheme: (1) errors arising from the interpolations used to estimate the velocity on the cell faces, and (2) errors associated with the slightly inconsistent pressure field used to ensure mass conservation for the cell face volume fluxes. It is shown that the interpolation error can be eliminated through the use of first-order accurate centered interpolation operators with mesh-independent weights. The pressure error appears to be intrinsic to the scheme and it is shown to scale as O($\Delta$t2$\Delta$x2). The effects of the conservation errors are investigated numerically through simulations of inviscid flow over an airfoil and in large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow. Neither the interpolation error nor the pressure error appear to lead to significant problems in the channel flow simulations where viscous dissipation is present and where the Cartesian mesh is stretched in only one direction. The inviscid airfoil simulations performed on a curvilinear mesh show a much greater sensitivity to the interpolation error. The standard second-order centered interpolation is shown to lead to severe numerical oscillations, while the kinetic energy-conserving first-order centered interpolation produces solutions that are almost as smooth as those obtained with a third-order upwind interpolation. When compared in channel flow simulations, however, the first-order centered interpolation is shown to be far superior to the third-order upwind interpolation, the latter being adversely affected by numerical dissipation. Only slight differences were noted when comparing channel flow simulations using first-order and second-order centered interpolations. These results suggest that numerical oscillations can be controlled in curvilinear coordinates through the use of properly-constructed non-dissipative centered interpolations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We empirically show that Bayesian inference can be inconsistent under misspecification in simple linear regression problems, both in a model averaging/selection and in a Bayesian ridge regression setting. We use the standard linear model, which assumes homoskedasticity, whereas the data are heteroskedastic, and observe that the posterior puts its mass on ever more high-dimensional models as the sample size increases. To remedy the problem, we equip the likelihood in Bayes' theorem with an exponent called the learning rate, and we propose the Safe Bayesian method to learn the learning rate from the data. SafeBayes tends to select small learning rates as soon the standard posterior is not `cumulatively concentrated', and its results on our data are quite encouraging.},

@article{Chkifa2015,
abstract = {The numerical approximation of parametric partial differential equations D(u,y)=0 is a computational challenge when the dimension d of the parameter vector y is large, due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. It was recently shown in [1,2] that, for a certain class of elliptic PDEs with diffusion coefficients depending on the parameters in an affine manner, there exist polynomial approximations to the solution map y↦u(y) with an algebraic convergence rate that is independent of the parametric dimension d. The analysis in [1,2] used, however, the affine parameter dependence of the operator. The present paper proposes a strategy for establishing similar results for classes of parametric PDEs that do not necessarily fall in this category. Our approach is based on building an analytic extension z↦u(z) of the solution map on certain tensor product of ellipses in the complex domain, and using this extension to estimate the Legendre coefficients of u. The varying semi-axes lengths of the ellipses in each coordinate z{\textless}inf{\textgreater}j{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reflect the anisotropy of the solution map with respect to the corresponding parametric variables y{\textless}inf{\textgreater}j{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. This allows us to derive algebraic convergence rates for tensorized Legendre expansions in the case d=∞. We also show that such rates are preserved when using certain interpolation procedures, which is an instance of a non-intrusive method. As examples of parametric PDEs that are covered by this approach, we consider (i) elliptic diffusion equations with coefficients that depend on the parameter vector y in a not necessarily affine manner, (ii) parabolic diffusion equations with similar dependence of the coefficient on y, (iii) nonlinear, monotone parametric elliptic PDEs, and (iv) elliptic equations set on a domain that is parametrized by the vector y. We give general strategies that allow us to derive the analytic extension in a unified abstract way for all these examples, in particular based on the holomorphic version of the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces. We expect that this approach can be applied to a large variety of parametric PDEs, showing that the curse of dimensionality can be overcome under mild assumptions.},

abstract = {Science-based simulation models are widely used to predict the behavior of complex physical systems. It is also common to use observations of the physical system to solve the inverse problem, i.e. to learn about the values of parameters within the model, a process often called calibration. The main goal of calibration is usually to improve the predictive performance of the simulator but the values of the parameters in the model may also be of intrinsic scientific interest in their own right. In order to make appropriate use of observations of the physical system it is impor-tant to recognise model discrepancy, the difference between reality and the simulator output. We illustrate through a simple example that an analysis that does not account for model discrepancy may lead to biased and over-confident parameter estimates and predictions. The challenge with incorporating model discrepancy in statistical inverse problems is the confounding with calibration parameters, which will only be resolved with mean-ingful priors. For our simple example, we model the model-discrepancy via a Gaus-sian Process and demonstrate that by accounting for model discrepancy our prediction within the range of data is correct. However, only with realistic priors on the model discrepancy do we uncover the true parameter values. Through theoretical arguments we show that these findings are typical of the general problem of learning about physical parameters and the underlying physical system using science-based mechanistic models.},

After you have captured the data, you need to curate it before you can start doing any kind of data analysis, and we lack good tools for both data curation and data analysis.

By this I mean that people collect a lot of data and then reduce this down to some number of column inches in Science or Nature—or 10 pages if it is a computer science person writing. So what I mean by data iceberg is that there is a lot of data that is collected but not curated or published in any systematic way.

Hence, for wind energy to make considerable con- tributions to the world's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envi- sioned and built. From a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. Of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10mthat comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. In this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (par- ticularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation.},

abstract = {We propose nested sequential Monte Carlo (NSMC), a methodology to sample from sequences of probability distributions, even where the random variables are high-dimensional. NSMC generalises the SMC framework by requiring only approximate, properly weighted, samples from the SMC proposal distribution, while still resulting in a correct SMC algorithm. Furthermore, NSMC can in itself be used to produce such properly weighted samples. Consequently, one NSMC sampler can be used to construct an efficient high-dimensional proposal distribution for another NSMC sampler, and this nesting of the algorithm can be done to an arbitrary degree. This allows us to consider complex and high-dimensional models using SMC. We show results that motivate the efficacy of our approach on several filtering problems with dimensions in the order of 100 to 1 000.},

abstract = {Surrogate models for computational simulations are input-output approximations that allow computationally intensive analyses, such as uncertainty propagation and inference, to be performed efficiently. When a simulation output does not depend smoothly on its inputs, the error and convergence rate of many approximation methods deteriorate substantially. This paper details a method for efficiently localizing discontinuities in the input parameter domain, so that the model output can be approximated as a piecewise smooth function. The approach comprises an initialization phase, which uses polynomial annihilation to assign function values to different regions and thus seed an automated labeling procedure, followed by a refinement phase that adaptively updates a kernel support vector machine representation of the separating surface via active learning. The overall approach avoids structured grids and exploits any available simplicity in the geometry of the separating surface, thus reducing the number of model evaluations required to localize the discontinuity. The method is illustrated on examples of up to eleven dimensions, including algebraic models and ODE/PDE systems, and demonstrates improved scaling and efficiency over other discontinuity localization approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyse different time integration methods for the two-fluid model and propose the BDF2 method as the preferred choice to simulate transient compressible multiphase flow in pipelines. Compared to the prevailing Backward Euler method, the BDF2 scheme has a significantly better accuracy (second order) while retaining the important property of unconditional linear stability (A-stability). In addition, it is capable of damping unresolved frequencies such as acoustic waves present in the compressible model (L-stability), opposite to the commonly used Crank–Nicolson method. The stability properties of the two-fluid model and of several discretizations in space and time have been investigated by eigenvalue analysis of the continuous equations, of the semi-discrete equations, and of the fully discrete equations. A method for performing an automatic von Neumann stability analysis is proposed that obtains the growth rate of the discretization methods without requiring symbolic manipulations and that can be applied without detailed knowledge of the source code. The strong performance of BDF2 is illustrated via several test cases related to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. A novel concept called Discrete Flow Pattern Map (DFPM) is introduced which describes the effective well-posed unstable flow regime as determined by the discretization method. Backward Euler introduces so much numerical diffusion that the theoretically well-posed unstable regime becomes numerically stable (at practical grid and timestep resolution). BDF2 accurately identifies the stability boundary, and reveals that in the nonlinear regime ill-posedness can occur when starting from well-posed unstable solutions. The well-posed unstable regime obtained in nonlinear simulations is therefore in practice much smaller than the theoretical one, which might severely limit the application of the two-fluid model for simulating the transition from stratified flow to slug flow. This should be taken very seriously into account when interpreting results from any slug-capturing simulations.},

abstract = {The NEPTUNE project constitutes the thermal-hydraulic part of the long-term Electricite{\&}acute; de France and Commissariat a{\&}grave; l'Energie Atomique joint research and development program for the next generation of nuclear reactor simulation tools. This program is also financially supported by the Institut de Radioprotection et Su{\&}circ;rete{\&}acute; Nucle{\&}acute;aire and AREVA NP. The project aims at developing a new software platform for advanced two-phase flow thermal hydraulics covering the whole range of modeling scales and allowing easy multiscale and multidisciplinary calculations. NEPTUNE is a fully integrated project that covers the following fields: software development, research in physical modeling and numerical methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques, and performance of new experimental programs. The analysis of the industrial needs points out that three main simulation scales are involved. The system scale is dedicated to the overall description of the reactor. The component or subchannel scale allows three-dimensional computations of the main components of the reactors: cores, steam generators, condensers, and heat exchangers. The current generation of system and component codes has reached a very high level of maturity for industrial applications. The third scale, computational fluid dynamics (CED) in open medium, allows one to go beyond the limits of the component scale for a finer description of the flows. This scale opens promising perspectives for industrial simulations, and the development and validation of the NEPTUNE CFD module have been a priority since the beginning of the project. It is based on advanced physical models (two-fluid or multifield model combined with interfacial area transport and two-phase turbulence) and modern numerical methods (fully unstructured finite volume solvers). For the system and component scales, prototype developments have also started, including new physical models and numerical methods. In addition to scale-specific developments, the generalized use of multiscale calculations is also expected to be a major means to meet the industrial needs. The coexistence of different simulation scales together with the fast growth of computing power multiplies the computation possibilities. In particular, thanks to the recent progress of CFD tools, one can imagine local zooms in some critical parts of the reactor components. The NEPTUNE multiscale platform will offer advanced coupling functionalities based on state-of-the-art software architecture and new numerical coupling techniques. Finally, despite the existence of a huge worldwide database of two-phase flow experiments, the validation of new physical models (more local, more complex) requires new experimental data. That is the reason why for several years we have been developing new instrumentation techniques such as four-sensor optical probes, X-ray tomography, and hot-wire anemometry. These techniques will be used for new experimental programs (currently being launched) that have been defined in connection with the high-priority industrial applications (departure from nucleate boiling, pressurized thermal shock, loss-of-coolant accident, etc.).},

abstract = {A second-order hybrid level set-volume constraint method (HLSVC) for numerically simulating deforming boundaries is presented. We combine the HLSVC interface advection algorithm with a two phase flow solver in order to numerically capture deforming bubbles and drops whose actual volume (s) fluctuate about fixed " target" volume (s). Three novel developments are described: (1) a new method for enforcing a volume constraint in which the number of bubbles and drops can change due to merging or splitting, (2) a new, second order, semi-lagrangian narrow band level set reinitialization algorithm, and (3) validation of a two-phase flow numerical method by comparison with linear stability analysis results for a . co-flowing liquid jet in gas. The new interface capturing method is tested on benchmark problems in which the velocity is prescribed (passive advection of interfaces) and in which the velocity is determined by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flow. The error in interface position when using the hybrid level set-volume constraint method is reported for many benchmark problems in polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and on an adaptive grid in which one criteria of adaptivity is the magnitude of the interface curvature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The RELAP-7 code is the next generation nuclear reactor system safety analysis code be- ing developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The code is based on the INL's modern scientific software development framework, MOOSE (Multi-Physics Object Ori- ented Simulation Environment). The overall design goal of RELAP-7 is to take advantage of the previous thirty years of advancements in computer architecture, software design, numerical integration methods, and physical models. The end result will be a reactor sys- tems analysis capability that retains and improves upon RELAP5's capability and extends the analysis capability for all reactor system simulation scenarios. RELAP-7 is a new project started in Fiscal Year 2012. It will become the main reactor systems simulation toolkit for the LWRS (Light Water Reactor Sustainability) program's RISMC (Risk Informed Safety Margin Characterization) effort and the next generation tool in the RELAP reactor safety/systems analysis application series (the eventual replace- ment for RELAP5). The key to the success of RELAP-7 is the simultaneous advancement of physical models, numerical methods, and software design while maintaining a solid user perspective. Physical models include both PDEs (Partial Differential Equations) and ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) and experimental based closure models. RELAP- 7 utilizes well-posed governing equations for compressible two-phase flow, which can be strictly verified in a modern verification and validation effort. Closure models used in RE- LAP5 and newly developed models will be reviewed and selected to reflect the progress made during the past three decades and provide a basis for the closure relations that will be required in RELAP-7. RELAP-7 uses modern numerical methods, which allow im- plicit time integration, second-order schemes in both time and space, and strongly coupled multi-physics. RELAP-7 is written with object oriented programming language C++. By using the MOOSE development environment, the RELAP-7 code is developed by following the same modern software design paradigms used for other MOOSE development efforts. The code is easy to read, develop, maintain, and couple with other codes. Most impor- tantly, the modern software design allows the RELAP-7 code to evolve efficiently with time. MOOSE is an HPC development and runtime framework for solving computational engineering problems in a well planned, managed, and coordinated way. By leveraging millions of lines of open source software packages, such as PETSC (a nonlinear solver de- veloped at Argonne National Laboratory) and LibMesh (a Finite Element Analysis pack- age developed at University of Texas), MOOSE reduces the expense and time required to develop new applications. MOOSE provides numerical integration methods and mesh management for parallel computation. Therefore RELAP-7 code developers have been able to focus more upon the physics and user interface capability. There are currently over 20 different MOOSE based applications ranging from 3-D transient neutron trans- port, detailed 3-D transient fuel performance analysis, to long-term material aging. Multi- physics and multi-dimensional analysis capabilities, such as radiation transport and fuel performance, can be obtained by coupling RELAP-7 and other MOOSE-based applica- tions through MOOSE and by leveraging with capabilities developed by other DOE pro- grams. This allows restricting the focus of RELAP-7 to systems analysis type simulations and gives priority to retain and significantly extend RELAP5's capabilities. During the Fiscal Year 2012, MOOSE was extended to better support system analysis code development. The software structure for RELAP-7 had been designed and developed. Numerical stability schemes for single-phase flow, which are needed for continuous finite element analysis, have been developed. Major physical components have been completed (designed and tested) to support a proof of concept demonstration of RELAP-7. The case selected for initial demonstration of RELAP-7 was the simulation of a two-loop, steady state PWR system. During Fiscal Year 2013, both the homogeneous equilibrium two- phase flow model and the seven-equation two-phase flow model have been implemented into RELAP-7. A number of physical components with two-phase flow capability have been developed to support the simplified boiling water reactor (BWR) station blackout (SBO) analyses. The demonstration case includes the major components for the primary system of a BWR, as well as the safety system components for reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and the wet well of a BWR containment. The homogeneous equilibrium two-phase flow model was used in the simplified BWR SBO analyses. During Fiscal Year 2014, more detailed implementation of the physical models as well as the code perfor- mance improvements associated with the seven-equation two-phase flow model are being carried out in order to demonstrate more refined BWR SBO analyses with more realistic geometries. In summary, the MOOSE based RELAP-7 code development is a new effort. The MOOSE framework enables rapid development of the RELAP-7 code. The developmental efforts and results demonstrate that the RELAP-7 project is on a path to success. This the- ory manual documents the main features implemented into the RELAP-7 code. Because the code is an ongoing development effort, this RELAP-7 Theory Manual will evolve with periodic updates to keep it current with the state of the development, implementation, and model additions/revisions.},

This solver, based on an elliptic oriented fractional step approach, is able to simulate multicomponent/multiphase flows. Discretization follows a 3D full unstructured finite volume approach, with a collocated arrangement of all variables. The non linear behaviour between pressure and volume fractions and a symmetric treatment of all fields are taken into account in the iterative procedure, within the time step. It greatly enforces the realizability of volume fractions (i.e 0{\textless}$\alpha${\textless}1), without artificial numerical needs. Applications to widespread test cases are shown to assess the accuracy and the robustness of the flow solver in different flow conditions, encountered in nuclear reactors pipes.},

@article{Kok2009,
abstract = {A new high-order finite-volume method is presented that preserves the skew symmetry of convection for the compressible flow equations. The method is intended for Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of compressible turbulent flows, in particular in the context of hybrid RANS-LES computations. The method is fourth-order accurate and has low numerical dissipation and dispersion. Due to the finite-volume approach, mass, momentum, and total energy are locally conserved. Furthermore, the skew-symmetry preservation implies that kinetic energy, sound-velocity, and internal energy are all locally conserved by convection as well. The method is unique in that all these properties hold on non-uniform, curvilinear, structured grids. Due to the conservation of kinetic energy, there is no spurious production or dissipation of kinetic energy stemming from the discretization of convection. This enhances the numerical stability and reduces the possible interference of numerical errors with the subgrid-scale model. By minimizing the numerical dispersion, the numerical errors are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to a standard fourth-order finite-volume method. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

For both this equation and the equations of principal interest - the Navier-Stokes equations, covered in detail in volume two - detailed discussion of both the continuous and discrete equations is presented, as well as explanations of how to properly march the time-dependent equations using smart implicit methods. Boundary and initial conditions, so important in applications, are carefully described and discussed, including well-posedness. The important role played by the pressure, so confusing in the past, is carefully explained. Together, this two volume work explains and emphasizes consistency in six areas: A- consistent mass matrix A- consistent pressure Poisson equation A- consistent penalty methods A- consistent normal direction A- consistent heat flux A- consistent forces Fully indexed and referenced, this book is an essential reference tool for all researchers, students and applied scientists in incompressible fluid mechanics.},

abstract = {This work proposes a method for model reduction of finite-volume models that guarantees the resulting reduced-order model is conservative, thereby preserving the structure intrinsic to finite-volume discretizations. The proposed reduced-order models associate with optimization problems characterized by a minimum-residual objective function and nonlinear equality constraints that explicitly enforce conservation over subdomains. Conservative Galerkin projection arises from formulating this optimization problem at the time-continuous level, while conservative least-squares Petrov--Galerkin (LSPG) projection associates with a time-discrete formulation. We equip these approaches with hyper-reduction techniques in the case of nonlinear flux and source terms, and also provide approaches for handling infeasibility. In addition, we perform analyses that include deriving conditions under which conservative Galerkin and conservative LSPG are equivalent, as well as deriving a posteriori error bounds. Numerical experiments performed on a parameterized quasi-1D Euler equation demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to ensure not only global conservation, but also significantly lower state-space errors than nonconservative reduced-order models such as standard Galerkin and LSPG projection.},

@article{Ruchi2017,
abstract = {Over the years, different data assimilation methods have been implemented to acquire improved estimations of model parameters by adjusting the uncertain parameter values in such a way that the mathematical model approximates the observed data as closely and consistently as possible. However, most of these methods are developed on the assumption of Gaussianity, e.g. Ensemble Kalman Filters, which is not the case in practical situations, and hence they result in poor estimations. In this work, the estimations of uncertain parameters are acquired from an Ensemble Square Root Kalman Filter and from a novel method, an Ensemble Transform Particle Filter, that does not have an assumption of Gaussianity. The latter method is developed on the backbone of Bayesian approach of sequential Monte Carlo with the framework of linear transport problem and has proved to be highly beneficial for systems with non-Gaussian distributions. We examine the performance of these methods in a twin experiment setup, when the observations of pressure are synthetically created based on the assumed true values of the uncertain parameters and implementing the Darcy flow model as the forward model, which is used for the data assimilation algorithm as well. We consider two test cases based on different geometrical configurations and distributions of permeability field across the domain representing low and high dimensional systems with small and large number of uncertain parameters, respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate that Ensemble Transform Particle Filter provides comparable results with that of Ensemble Square Root Kalman Filter for the low dimensional system and outperforms it for the high dimensional system.},

However, space-and time-discretization methods typically corrupt this property, leading to violation of the inviscid conservation principles. This work investigates the discrete helicity conservation properties of spectral and finite-differencing methods, in relation to the form employed for the convective term. Effects due to Runge-Kutta time-advancement schemes are also taken into consideration in the analysis. The theoretical results are proved against inviscid numerical simulations, while a scale-dependent analysis of energy, helicity and their non-linear transfers is performed to further characterize the discretization errors of the different forms in forced helical turbulence simulations.},

Numerical experiments show that if the problem is smooth in time and if second order accuracy is sufficient, the linearly implicit methods can be significantly more efficient at large time steps.

abstract = {We propose a conservative, second-order accurate immersed interface method for representing incompressible fluid flows over complex three dimensional solid obstacles on a staggered Cartesian grid. The method is based on a finite-volume discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which is modified locally in cells that are cut by the interface in such a way that accuracy and conservativity are maintained. A level-set technique is used for description and tracking of the interface geometry, so that an extension of the method to moving boundaries and flexible walls is straightforward. Numerical stability is ensured for small cells by a conservative mixing procedure. Discrete conservation and sharp representation of the fluid-solid interface render the method particularly suitable for Large-Eddy Simulations of high-Reynolds number flows. Accuracy, second-order grid convergence and robustness of the method is demonstrated for several test cases: inclined channel flow at Re= 20, flow over a square cylinder at Re= 100, flow over a circular cylinder at Re= 40, Re= 100 and Re= 3900, as well as turbulent channel flow with periodic constrictions at Re= 10,595. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, an iterated PISO-like procedure based on Rhie-Chow correction was used to handle pressure-velocity coupling within each implicit RK stage. For the explicit approach, a projected scheme was used to avoid the "checker-board" effect. The above-mentioned approaches were also extended to flow problems involving heat transfer. It is worth noting that the numerical technology available in the OpenFOAM library was used for space discretization.In this work, we additionally explore the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed implementations by computing several unsteady flow benchmarks; we also show that the numerical diffusion due to the time integration approach is completely canceled using the solution techniques proposed here.},

abstract = {The search for multivariate quadrature rules of minimal size with a specified polynomial accuracy has been the topic of many years of research. Finding such a rule allows accurate integration of moments, which play a central role in many aspects of scientific computing with complex models. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide novel mathematical analysis of the polynomial quadrature problem that provides a lower bound for the minimal possible number of nodes in a polynomial rule with specified accuracy. We give concrete but simplistic multivariate examples where a minimal quadrature rule can be designed that achieves this lower bound, along with situations that showcase when it is not possible to achieve this lower bound. Our second main contribution comes in the formulation of an algorithm that is able to efficiently generate multivariate quadrature rules with positive weights on non-tensorial domains. Our tests show success of this procedure in up to 20 dimensions. We test our method on applications to dimension reduction and chemical kinetics problems, including comparisons against popular alternatives such as sparse grids, Monte Carlo and quasi Monte Carlo sequences, and Stroud rules. The quadrature rules computed in this paper outperform these alternatives in almost all scenarios.},

abstract = {The feasibility of a transportable artificial neural network (ANN)-based technique for the classification of flow regimes in three phase gas/liquid/pulp fiber systems by using pressure signals as input was examined. Experimental data obtained in a vertical, circular column 1.8 m in height and 5.08 cm in diameter, with air/water/Kraft softwood paper pulp, were used. The pulp consistency (weight percent of dry pulp in the pulp-water mixture) was varied in the 0.0-1.5{\%} range. Local pressure fluctuations were recorded at three different stations along the column using three independent but principally similar transducers. An ANN was designed, trained and tested for the classification of the flow regimes using as input some density characteristics of the power spectrum for one of the normalized pressure signals (from Sensor 1), and was shown to predict the flow regimes with good accuracy. A voting scheme was also examined in which the three sensors fed separately trained ANNs, and a correct flow regime would require a vote from at least two of the three ANNs. This scheme improved the agreement between the model predictions and the data. The ANN trained and tested for Sensor 1 predicted the flow regimes reasonably well when applied directly to the normalized pressure power spectrum density characteristics of the other two sensors, indicating a good deal of transportability. For further improvement of transportability, an ANN-based method was also developed, whereby the power spectrum density characteristics of other sensors were adjusted before they were used as input to the ANN that was based on Sensor 1 alone. The method was shown to improve the accuracy of the flow regime predictions. This method requires in practice, that the "replacement" sensor to which regime identification is transported will be, for some while, in simultaneous use with the sensor to be replaced; then the training of the "input-adjusting" ANN would be possible in industry practice. Such a situation is realistic for sensitive processes, where redundant sensors are implemented for fault tolerance. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dual-energy gamma densitometry offers a powerful technique for the non-intrusive analysis of multiphase flows. By employing multiple beam lines, information on the phase configuration can be obtained. Once the configuration is known, it then becomes possible in principle to determine the phase fractions. In practice, however, the extraction of the phase fractions from the densitometer data is complicated by the wide variety of phase configurations which can arise, and by the considerable difficulties of modelling multiphase flows. In this paper we show that neural network techniques provide a powerful approach to the analysis of data from dual-energy gamma densitometers, allowing both the phase configuration and the phase fractions to be determined with high accuracy, whilst avoiding the uncertainties associated with modelling. The technique is well suited to the determination of oil, water and gas fractions in multiphase oil pipelines. Results from linear and non-linear network models are compared, and a new technique for validating the network output is described. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of multiphase flows, using a front-tracking method, are presented. The method is based on writing one set of governing equations for the whole computational domain and treating the different phases as one fluid with variable material properties. Interfacial terms are accounted for by adding the ap-propriate sources as $\delta$ functions at the boundary separating the phases. The unsteady Navier–Stokes equations are solved by a conventional finite volume method on a fixed, structured grid and the interface, or front, is tracked explicitly by connected marker points. Interfacial source terms such as surface tension are computed on the front and transferred to the fixed grid. Advection of fluid properties such as density is done by following the motion of the front. The method has been implemented for fully three-dimensional flows, as well as for two-dimensional and axisymmetric ones. First, the method is described for the flow of two or more isothermal phases. The representation of the moving interface and its dynamic restructuring, as well as the transfer of information between the moving front and the fixed grid, are dis-cussed. Applications and extensions of the method to homogeneous bubbly flows, atomization, flows with variable surface tension, solidification, and boiling are then presented. c},

abstract = {This paper concerns the application and solver robustness of the Newton-Krylov method in solving two-phase flow drift-flux model problems using high-order numerical schemes. In our previous studies, the Newton-Krylov method has been proven as a promising solver for two-phase flow drift-flux model problems. However, these studies were limited to use first-order numerical schemes only. Moreover, the previous approach to treating the drift-flux closure correlations was later revealed to cause deteriorated solver convergence performance, when the mesh was highly refined, and also when higher-order numerical schemes were employed. In this study, a second-order spatial discretization scheme that has been tested with two-fluid two-phase flow model was extended to solve drift-flux model problems. In order to improve solver robustness, and therefore efficiency, a new approach was proposed to treating the mean drift velocity of the gas phase as a primary nonlinear variable to the equation system. With this new approach, significant improvement in solver robustness was achieved. With highly refined mesh, the proposed treatment along with the Newton-Krylov solver were extensively tested with two-phase flow problems that cover a wide range of thermal-hydraulics conditions. Satisfactory convergence performances were observed for all test cases. Numerical verification was then performed in the form of mesh convergence studies, from which expected orders of accuracy were obtained for both the first-order and the second-order spatial discretization schemes. At last, the drift-flux model, along with numerical methods presented, were validated with three sets of flow boiling experiments that cover different flow channel geometries (round tube, rectangular tube, and rod bundle), and a wide range of test conditions (pressure, mass flux, wall heat flux, inlet subcooling and outlet void fraction).},

abstract = {The majority of the existing reactor system analysis codes were developed using low-order numerical schemes in both space and time. In many nuclear thermal-hydraulics applications, it is desirable to use higher-order numerical schemes to reduce numerical errors. High-resolution spatial discretization schemes provide high order spatial accuracy in smooth regions and capture sharp spatial discontinuity without nonphysical spatial oscillations. In this work, we adapted an existing high-resolution spatial discretization scheme on staggered grids in two-phase flow applications. Fully implicit time integration schemes were also implemented to reduce numerical errors from operator-splitting types of time integration schemes. The resulting nonlinear system has been successfully solved using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method. The high-resolution spatial discretization and high-order fully implicit time integration numerical schemes were tested and numerically verified for several two-phase test problems, including a two-phase advection problem, a two-phase advection with phase appearance/disappearance problem, and the water faucet problem. Numerical results clearly demonstrated the advantages of using such high-resolution spatial and high-order temporal numerical schemes to significantly reduce numerical diffusion and therefore improve accuracy. Our study also demonstrated that the JFNK method is stable and robust in solving two-phase flow problems, even when phase appearance/disappearance exists.},

@article{Boyd2011,
abstract = {Approximating a smooth function from its values f(xi) at a set of evenly spaced points xi through P-point polynomial interpolation often fails because of divergence near the endpoints, the "Runge Phenomenon". This report shows how to achieve an error that decreases exponentially fast with P by means of polynomial interpolation on Ns subdomains where Ns increases with P. We rigorously prove that in the limit both Ns and M, the degree on each subdomain, increase simultaneously, the approximation error converges proportionally to exp(-constantPlog(P)). Thus, division into ever-shrinking, ever-more-numerous subdomains is guaranteed to defeat the Runge Phenomenon in infinite precision arithmetic. (Numerical ill-conditioning is also discussed, but is not a great difficulty in practice, though not insignificant in theory.) Although a Chebyshev grid on each subdomain is well known to be immune to the Runge Phenomenon, it is still interesting, and the same methodology can be applied as to a uniform grid. When a Chebyshev grid is used on each subdomain, there are two regimes. If c is the distance from the middle of the interval [-1,1] to the nearest singularity of f(x) in the complex plane, then when cNsb *1, the error is proportional to exp(-cP), independent of the number of subdomains. When cNsb +1, the rate of convergence slows to exp(-constantPlog(P)), the same as for equispaced interpolation. However, the Chebyshev multidomain error is always smaller than the equispaced multidomain error. {\textcopyright} 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ransom1984,
abstract = {For some time it has been known that many of the two-phase flow models lead to ill-posed Cauchy problems because they have complex characteristic values. A necessary condition (at least in the linear case) for the Cauchy problem to be well-posed is that it be stable in the sense of von Neumann. For systems of partial differential equations of first order, stability in the sense of von Neumann is essentially equivalent to the condition that the model be hyperbolic (all real characteristic values and complete set of characteristic vectors). Herein models are developed which have real characteristic values for all physically acceptable states (state space) and except for a set of measure zero have a complete set of characteristic vectors in state space. Therefore, these models are hyperbolic a.e. (almost everywhere) in state space. Also, they are stable in the sense of von Neumann a.e. in state space even without inclusion of viscosity terms. The models discussed herein are developed for the case of two-phase separated planar flow and include transverse momentum considerations. These models are referred to as "two-pressure" models because each phase is assumed to exist at an average pressure different from the average pressure in the other phase; the pressure fields are related through momentum considerations. Numerical results on a steady-state problem show good agreement with existing steady-state results. Numerical results on a transient problem agree with a single-pressure model until the onset of numerical instability in the single-pressure model. Compared to the single-pressure (hydrostatic) model, the two-pressure model approximates additional physical features and is shown to be a viable approach for the case of separated flow. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {A 1D TFM numerical simulation of near horizontal stratified two-phase flow is performed where the TFM, including surface tension and viscous stresses, is simplified to a two-equation model using the fixed-flux approximation. As the angle of inclination of the channel increases so does the driving body force, so the flow becomes KH unstable, and waves grow and develop nonlinearities. It is shown that these waves grow until they reach a limit cycle due to viscous dissipation at wave fronts. Upon further inclination of the channel, chaos is observed. The appearance of chaos in a 1D TFM implies a nonlinear process that transfers energy intermittently from long wavelengths where energy is produced to short wavelengths where energy is dissipated by viscosity, so that an averaged energy equilibrium in frequency space is attained. This is comparable to the well-known turbulent stability mechanism of the multi-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations, i.e., chaos implies Lyapunov stability, but in this case it is strictly a two-phase phenomenon.},

@article{Trefethen2011,
abstract = {I t is a pleasure to offer this essay for Mathematics Today as a record of my Summer Lecture on 29 June 2011 at the Royal Society. Polynomials are as basic a topic as any in mathematics, and for numerical mathematicians like me, they are the starting point of numerical methods that in some cases go back centuries, like quadrature formulae for numerical integration and Newton itera-tions for finding roots. You would think that by now, the basic facts about computing with polynomials would be widely under-stood. In fact, the situation is almost the reverse. There are indeed widespread views about polynomials, but some of the important ones are wrong, founded on misconceptions entrenched by gener-ations of textbooks. Since 2006, my colleagues and I have been solving mathemat-ical problems with polynomials using the Chebfun software sys-tem (www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun). We have learned from daily experience how fast and reliable polynomials are. This en-tirely positive record has made me curious to try to pin down where these misconceptions come from, and this essay is an at-tempt to summarise some of my findings. Full details, including precise definitions and theorems, can be found in my draft book Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice, available at www.maths.ox.ac.uk/{\~{}}trefethen. The essay is organised around 'six myths'. Each myth has some truth in it – mathematicians rarely say things that are simply false! Yet each one misses something important. Throughout the discussion, f is a continuous function defined on the interval [−1, 1], n + 1 distinct points x 0 , . . . , x n in [−1, 1] are given, and p n is the unique polynomial of degree at most n with p n (x j) = f (x j) for each j. Two families of points will be of partic-ular interest: equispaced points, x j = −1 + 2j/n, and Chebyshev points, x j = cos(j$\pi$/n). I will also mention Legendre points, de-fined as the zeros of the degree n + 1 Legendre polynomial P n+1 . The discussion of each myth begins with two or three represen-tative quotations from leading textbooks, listed anonymously with the year of publication. Then I say a word about the mathematical truth underlying the myth, and after that, what that truth overlooks. Myth 1. Polynomial interpolants diverge as n → ∞ Textbooks regularly warn students not to expect p n → f as n → ∞. 'Polynomial interpolants rarely converge to a general continuous function.' (1989) 'Unfortunately, there are functions for which inter-polation at the Chebyshev points fails to converge.' (1996) On the face of it, this caution is justified by two theorems. Weierstrass proved in 1885 [1] that any continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by polynomials. On the other hand, Faber proved in 1914 [2] that no polynomial interpolation scheme, no matter how the points are distributed, will converge for all such functions. So it sounds as if there is something wrong with polynomial in-terpolation. Yet the truth is, polynomial interpolants in Chebyshev points always converge if f is a little bit smooth. (We shall call them Chebyshev interpolants.) Lipschitz continuity is more than enough, that is, |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ L|x − y| for some constant L and all x, y ∈ [−1, 1]. So long as f is Lipschitz continuous, as it will be in almost any practical application, p n → f is guaranteed. There is indeed a big problem with convergence of polynomial interpolants, but it pertains to interpolation in equispaced points. As Runge showed in 1901 [3], equispaced interpolants may diverge exponentially, even if f is so smooth as to be analytic (holomor-phic). This genuinely important fact, known as the Runge phe-nomenon, has confused people. With Faber's theorem seeming to provide justification, a real problem with equispaced polynomial interpolants has been overgeneralised so that people have suspected it of applying to polynomial interpolants in general. The smoother f is, the faster its Chebyshev interpolants con-verge. If f has $\nu$ derivatives, with the $\nu$ th derivative being of bounded variation V , then − p n = O(V n −$\nu$) as n → ∞. (By − p n I mean the maximum of |f (x) − p n (x)| for x ∈ [−1, 1].) If f is analytic, the convergence is geometric, with − p n = O($\rho$ −n) for some $\rho$ {\textgreater} 1. I will give details about the parameter $\rho$ under Myth 5. For example, here is the degree 10,000 Chebyshev interpolant p n to the sawtooth function f (x) defined as the integral from −1 to x of sign(sin(100t/(2 − t))). This curve may not look like a polynomial, but it is! With − p n ≈ 0.0001, the plot is indis-tinguishable from a plot of f itself. 1885 that any continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by poly-nomials. On the other hand, Faber proved in 1914 that no polynomial interpolation scheme, no matter how the points are distributed, will converge for all such functions. So it sounds as if there is something wrong with polynomial interpolation. Yet the truth is, polynomial interpolants in Chebyshev points always converge if f is a little bit smooth (we shall call them Chebyshev interpolants).

abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multi-ple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the sys-tem with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are lever-aged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity meth-ods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncer-tainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

abstract = {With growing interest in understanding the magnitudes and sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling, the difficult problem of characterizing model structure adequacy is now attracting considerable attention. Here, we examine this problem via a model-structure- independent approach based in information theory. In particular, we (a) discuss how to assess and compute the information content in multivariate hydrological data, (b) present practical methods for quantifying the uncertainty and shared information in data while accounting for heteroscedasticity, (c) show how these tools can be used to estimate the best achievable predictive performance of a model (for a system given the available data), and (d) show how model adequacy can be characterized in terms of the magnitude and nature of its aleatory uncertainty that cannot be diminished (and is resolvable only up to specification of its density), and its epistemic uncertainty that can, in principle, be suitably resolved by improving the model. An illustrative modeling example is provided using catchment-scale data from three river basins, the Leaf and Chunky River basins in the United States and the Chuzhou basin in China. Our analysis shows that the aleatory uncertainty associated with making catchment simulations using this data set is significant ({\~{}}50{\%}). Further, estimated epistemic uncertainties of the HyMod, SAC-SMA, and Xinanjiang model hypotheses indicate that considerable room for model structural improvements remain.},

abstract = {This paper describes the testing, comparison and application of global sensitivity techniques for the study of the impact of the stream impurities on CO2 pipeline failure. Global sensitivity analysis through non-intrusive generalised polynomial chaos expansion with sparse grids is compared to more common techniques and is found to achieve superior convergence rate to crude Monte Carlo, quasi-Monte Carlo and EFAST for functions with up to a moderate level of roughness. This methodology is then applied to the hypothetical full bore rupture of a 1 km CO2 pipeline at 150 bara and 283.15 K. The sensitivity of the ensuing outflow to the composition of a quaternary mixture of CO2 with N2, CH4 and O2 as representative stream impurities. The results indicate that the outflow rate is highly sensitive to the composition during the early stages of depressurisation, where the effect of the impurities on phase equilibria has a significant impact on the outflow. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of sparse recovery techniques in the approximation of high-dimensional functions has garnered increasing interest. In this work, we present a survey of recent progress in this emerging topic. Our main focus is on the computation of polynomial approximations of high-dimensional functions on d- dimensional hypercubes.We show that that smooth, multivariate functions possess expansions in orthogonal polynomial bases that are not only approximately sparse, but possess a particular type of structured sparsity defined by so-called lower sets. This structure can be exploited via the use of weighted ℓ1 minimization techniques, and, as we show, doing so leads to sample complexity estimates that are at most logarithmically dependent on the dimension d. Hence the curse of dimensionality – the bane of high-dimensional approximation – is mitigated to a significant extent. We also discuss several practical issues, including unknown noise (due to truncation or numerical error), and highlight a number of open problems and challenges. 1},

abstract = {The sources and characters of uncertainties in engineering modeling for risk and reliability analyses are discussed. While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Agarwal2009,
abstract = {In the design of wind turbines-onshore or offshore-the prediction of extreme loads associated with a target return period requires statistical extrapolation from available loads data. The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic timedomain simulation of the inflow turbulence, the incident waves, and the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed. While for the wind, inflow turbulence models are relatively well established; for wave input, the current practice is to model irregular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. Such a wave model does not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to this less realistic wave model, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on an offshore wind turbine with a focus on the fore-aft tower bending moment at the mudline. We use a 5 MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, simpler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify governing environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are associated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We present the nonlinear irregular wave model next and incorporate it into an integrated wind-wave response simulation analysis program for offshore wind turbines. We compute turbine loads for the governing environmental conditions identified with the linear model and also for an extreme environmental state. We show that computed loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines.

abstract = {Wind farm flow models have advanced considerably with the use of large eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations. The main limitation of these techniques is their high computational time requirements; which makes their use for wind farm annual energy production (AEP) predictions expensive. The objective of the present paper is to minimize the number of model evaluations required to capture the wind power plant's AEP using stationary wind farm flow models. Polynomial chaos techniques are proposed based on arbitrary Weibull distributed wind speed and Von Misses distributed wind direction. The correlation between wind direction and wind speed are captured by defining Weibull-parameters as functions of wind direction. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these methods the expectation and variance of the wind farm power distributions are compared against the traditional binning method with trapezoidal and Simpson's integration rules. The wind farm flow model used in this study is the semi-empirical wake model developed by Larsen [1]. Three test cases are studied: a single turbine, a simple and a real offshore wind power plant. A reduced number of model evaluations for a general wind power plant is proposed based on the convergence of the present method for each case.},

abstract = {In order to make offshore wind power a cost effective solution that can compete with the traditional fossil energy sources, cost reductions on the expensive offshore support structures are required. One way to achieve this, is to reduce the uncertainty in wave load calculations by using a more advanced model for wave kinematics. As offshore wind turbines are generally sited in shallow water, nonlinear effects which results in steeper waves with higher velocities and accelerations are common. Whereas extreme waves are modeled with higher-order nonlinear regular wave models, fatigue loads are calculated from kinematics obtained by a low-fidelity linear irregular wave model. In this paper, a second-order wave model that is employed to simulate the dynamic response due to nonlinear irregular waves on a full set of IEC-standard load cases. This method is computationally efficient, which is particularly useful for design optimization studies. It is shown that by using this method for a 25 m deep site in the German Bight, equivalent fatigue loads increase by 7.5 {\%} compared to the traditional linear wave model. The effect of nonlinear waves on fatigue is most prevalent in the foundation and tower parts near the sea surface. Furthermore, it is found that the increase in fatigue damage accumulation is most prevalent in wind-wave misaligned load cases, in which aerodynamic damping is absent.},

The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with obtaining estimates for the error in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations based on the Launder-Sharma k $\epsilon$ turbulence closure model, for a limited class of flows. In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Compared to the earlier work, the present method poses significant improvements for high dimensional problems. The core of the algorithms relies on adaptive refinement of sparse grids. It is demonstrated that in the commonly encountered cases where a discontinuity resides on a small subset of the dimensions, the present method becomes "optimal", in the sense that the total number of points required for function evaluations depends linearly on the dimensionality of the space. The details of the algorithms will be presented and various numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We propose a multi-element stochastic collocation method that can be applied in high-dimensional parameter space for functions with discontinuities lying along manifolds of general geometries. The key feature of the method is that the parameter space is decomposed into multiple elements defined by the discontinuities and thus only the minimal number of elements are utilized. On each of the resulting elements the function is smooth and can be approximated using high-order methods with fast convergence properties. The decomposition strategy is in direct contrast to the traditional multi-element approaches which define the sub-domains by repeated splitting of the axes in the parameter space. Such methods are more prone to the curse-of-dimensionality because of the fast growth of the number of elements caused by the axis based splitting. The present method is a two-step approach. Firstly a discontinuity detector is used to partition parameter space into disjoint elements in each of which the function is smooth. The detector uses an efficient combination of the high-order polynomial annihilation technique along with adaptive sparse grids, and this allows resolution of general discontinuities with a smaller number of points when the discontinuity manifold is low-dimensional. After partitioning, an adaptive technique based on the least orthogonal interpolant is used to construct a generalized Polynomial Chaos surrogate on each element. The adaptive technique reuses all information from the partitioning and is variance-suppressing. We present numerous numerical examples that illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of the method. When compared against standard locally-adaptive sparse grid methods, the present method uses many fewer number of collocation samples and is more accurate. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The sources and characterization of uncertainties in engineering modeling for risk and reliability analy- ses are discussed. While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce depend- ence between events, which may not be properly noted if their character is not correctly modeled. Influ- ences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influ- ence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliabil- ity problems.},

@article{Agarwal2008b,
abstract = {In the design of wind turbines—onshore or offshore—the prediction of extreme loads as- sociated with a target (long) return period requires statistical extrapolation from available loads data. The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic time- domain simulation of the inflow turbulence and of the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed, both for the turbine and for the input wind/wave conditions. While for the wind, inflow turbu- lence models are fairly well established due to the relative maturity of the industry for onshore wind energy development, for wave input, the current practice is to model irreg- ular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. These wave modeling assumptions do not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to these less realistic (albeit simple) representations of ocean waves, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on the support structure (monopile) of an offshore wind turbine. We use a 5MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, the sim- pler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify controlling environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are asso- ciated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We then present the theory for an improved nonlinear second-order irregular wave modeling approach which we use to compute hydrodynamic loads on a stand-alone monopile analyzed quasi-statically for the controlling long-term design environmental con- ditions identified from the linear model. We demonstrate that computed hydrodynamic loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines. This motivates the need for continuing work directed towards incorporation of nonlinear irregular wave models in turbine response simulation studies and loads extrapolation for design.},

Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model.

abstract = {Simulations of blood flow in both healthy and diseased vascular models can be used to compute a range of hemodynamic parameters including velocities, time varying wall shear stress, pressure drops, and energy losses. The confidence in the data output from cardiovascular simulations depends directly on our level of certainty in simulation input parameters. In this work, we develop a general set of tools to evaluate the sensitivity of output parameters to input uncertainties in cardiovascular simulations. Uncertainties can arise from boundary conditions, geometrical parameters, or clinical data. These uncertainties result in a range of possible outputs which are quantified using probability density functions (PDFs). The objective is to systemically model the input uncertainties and quantify the confidence in the output of hemodynamic simulations. Input uncertainties are quantified and mapped to the stochastic space using the stochastic collocation technique. We develop an adaptive collocation algorithm for Gauss-Lobatto-Chebyshev grid points that significantly reduces computational cost. This analysis is performed on two idealized problems--an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a carotid artery bifurcation, and one patient specific problem--a Fontan procedure for congenital heart defects. In each case, relevant hemodynamic features are extracted and their uncertainty is quantified. Uncertainty quantification of the hemodynamic simulations is done using (a) stochastic space representations, (b) PDFs, and (c) the confidence intervals for a specified level of confidence in each problem.},

In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. In our method, sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$}-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems. Several examples of flow fields resulting from numerical simulations and physical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Periodic pigging of oil and gas pipelines for dewatering, cleaning and inspecting is a standard industry procedure. Predicting the motion of a pig to estimate its velocity, position and required driving pressure is essential before pigging. To enhance these predictions, the frictional force between pig and pipeline is a key determinant and insufficient understanding of the frictional force characteristics leads to significant inaccuracies. As the frictional force acting parallel to the pipeline wall plane is a function of contact force in the radial direction, a 2D axisymmetric nonlinear finite element model was proposed to predict the contact force experienced by bi-directional pig by using ANSYS. The impacts of four parameters (including interference, thickness, chamfer dimension and clamping rate of the sealing discs) on the contact force and the deflection angle of the sealing disc are studied at different differential pressures over the pig. Results obtained in this study shows that the thickness of the sealing disc has the greatest impact on contact force of the bi-directional pig, followed by the chamfer dimension, then the clamping rate and finally the interference. A linear relationship between the contact force and the differential pressure can also be observed from the results. Research findings on the characteristic of contact force and deflection angle of sealing disc may provide useful information for the formulation of theoretical or mathematical models to predict the frictional force on the pig, and pigging risks may be efficiently reduced by establish mitigating strategies on the basis of prediction.},

Ensemble-averaged shapes of elongated bubbles were determined for a wide range of gas and liquid flow rates, as well as for different pipe inclination angles. The elongated bubble nose can be characterized by an annular domain where liquid is present above the gas. The effect of gas and liquid flow rates, as well as of the pipe inclination angle on the bubble shape (front and tail) is studied.

abstract = {Transient response due to gust loads can lead to structural failure despite the fact that the aero-elastic system is asymptotically stable. Unsteady aeroelastic analysis should therefore be included in the load calculation cycle of the aircraft design process. Especially in the transonic regime, partitioned strong coupling algorithms perform better than loose coupling algorithms and allow larger time-steps in the unsteady simulation. However, the simulation of high fidelity unsteady fluid-structure interaction using strong coupling algorithms is currently too expensive in order to be useful in industry.To accelerate high fidelity partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations we apply space-mapping, which is a technique that originates from the field of multi-fidelity optimization. Without loss of generality we assume the availability of a cheap low fidelity fluid solver and an expensive high fidelity fluid solver. The space-mapping approach is used to accelerate the high fidelity computation using black-box input/output information of both the high fidelity fluid solver and low fidelity fluid solver. In order to achieve this, a space-mapping function is defined on the fluid-structure interface which keeps track of the differences between the high fidelity model and the low fidelity model during the coupling iterations. Reformulating the root-finding problem on the fluid-structure interaction interface using the space-mapping function results in the Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm.The Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm is applied to 1-D and 2-D test cases in order to assess the speedup with respect to the Quasi-Newton Inverse Least Squares algorithm. The latter is considered to be the current state of the art in partitioned strong coupling algorithms. The observed speedup depends mainly on the type of FSI problem and the time step size. The maximum observed speedup is about 1.5.The application of the space-mapping technique to partitioned fluid-structure interaction problems is found to be a promising approach. The framework is non-intrusive and allows the reuse of existing solvers which is especially useful in an industrial environment. It is expected that the space-mapping technique can be combined with higher order time integration schemes that maintain accuracy over a large range of time step sizes.},

abstract = {The theory of port-Hamiltonian systems provides a framework for the geometric description of network models of physical systems. It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system. The port-Hamiltonian description offers a systematic framework for analysis, control and simulation of complex physical systems, for lumped-parameter as well as for distributed-parameter models.},

abstract = {A new turbulence modelling approach (Very-Large Eddy Simulation; V-LES) is developed and compared to conventional RANS and LES for a flow across a tube bundle. The method, which belongs to the large-scale simulation category, represents a good compromise between efficiency and precision, and may thus be used for industrial problems for which LES remains computationally expensive under high to very-high Reynolds number flow conditions. It can also be used for gas-liquid two-phase flows such as pressurized thermal shocks. The method is a sort of blend between U-RANS and LES, in that it resolves very large structures - way larger than the grid size - and models all subscale of turbulence using a two-equation model, by reference to RANS. The original model is shown here to share the same characteristics as the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach, in that when the filter width is smaller than the wall-distance at which viscous effects are negligible (f?? = 1), the fixed filter width is replaced by the wall distance. First conclusions to be drawn from its extension here is that the flow must be resolved in three-dimensions, under transient conditions, with refined grids. Sensitivity to various computational parameters has been addressed: grid, filter width, domain size, and inflow conditions. This modelling strategy is proved to provide the flow unsteadiness in three-dimensions, while saving computational cost compared to LES. The method is computationally efficient (it can be applied using an implicit solver which permits a higher CFL than with LES; typically 1 versus 0.1), and numerically robust. The computational cost decreases with increasing filter width, though at the expenses of the quality of the results. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new parallel, computationally efficient immersed boundary method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta function approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike Peskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are used to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are solved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function techniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural free-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive grid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting operations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the immersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical discrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with specialized half-explicit Runge–Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently solve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum equation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems of equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved using an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic properties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to simple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are compatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference equations. Numerical experiments on low-aspect-ratio flat plates and spheres at Reynolds numbers up to 3700 are used to verify the accuracy and physical fidelity of the formulation.},

By appealing to the difference between slowly and rapidly varying quantities, it is shown that the natural closure of these terms leads to the use of a single, slowly-varying combined average flux, common to both phases, plus rapidly-varying local contributions for each phase. The result is general and only rests on the hypothesis that the spatial variation of the combined average flux is adequately described by a linear function of position within the averaging volume. No further hypotheses on the nature of the flow (e.g., about specific flow regimes) prove necessary. The result agrees with earlier ones obtained by ensemble averaging, is illustrated with the example of disperse flows and discussed in the light of some earlier and current literature. A very concise derivation of the general averaged balance equation is also given.},

abstract = {To reliably solve PDAE models in established equation-oriented modeling environments (i) certain mathematical properties are to be fulfilled and (ii) the specified initial- and boundary conditions are to be consistent. For an assessment of both of these aspects an important theoretical framework is the concept of index. In this contribution we propose a new method for a systematic index reduction of quasi-linear PDAE systems. The general idea is to reveal quasi-linear combinations of the differential quantities in the high-index model which are invariant with respect to a specific independent variable. By using these quasi-linear combinations as templates for symbolic manipulations, additional algebraic constraints become explicit. These explicit constraints are then used for index reduction yielding low-index PDAE models. The procedure is demonstrated in the context of a typical modeling work-flow for modeling problems of a tubular reactor, diffusive charge transport in electrolyte mixtures and incompressible fluid flow.},

A fully three-dimensional model is obtained from the time averaging, whereas the one-dimensional model is developed from the area averaging. The constitutive equations for the interfacial terms are the weakest link in a two-fluid model because of considerable difficulties in terms of experimentation and modeling. However, these are of supreme importance in determining phase interactions. In view of this, the interfacial transfer terms have been studied in great detail both for the three- and one-dimensional models. New interfacial area, drag, virtual mass, droplet size and entrainment correlations are presented. In the one-dimensional model, a number of serious shortcomings of the conventional model have been pointed out and new formulations to eliminate them are presented. These shortcomings mainly arose due to the improper consideration of phase distributions in the transverse direction. ?? 1984.},

abstract = {A unified, asymptotically-preserving method for simulating multiphase flows using an exactly mass, momentum, and energy conserving Cell-Integrated Semi-Lagrangian advection algorithm is presented. The new algorithm uses a semi-implicit pressure update scheme that asymptotically preserves the standard incompressible pressure projection method in the limit of infinite sound speed. The asymptotically preserving attribute makes the new method applicable to compressible and incompressible flows, including stiff materials, which enables large time steps characteristic of incompressible flow algorithms rather than the small time steps required by explicit methods. Shocks are captured and material discontinuities are tracked, without the aid of any approximate or exact Riemann solvers. The new method enables one to simulate the flow of multiple materials, each possessing a potentially exotic equation of state. Simulations of multiphase flow in one and two dimensions are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm at efficiently computing multiphase flows containing shock waves and material discontinuities with large “impedance mismatch.” Additionally, new techniques related to the Moment-of-Fluid interface reconstruction are presented, including a novel, asymptotically-preserving method for capturing “filaments,” and an improved method for initializing the Moment-of-Fluid optimization problem on unstructured, triangular grids.},

Unlike the conventional explicit integration schemes, it is not based on a standard CFL condition. Instead, the eigenvalues of the dynamical system are analytically bounded and the linear stability domain of the time-integration scheme is adapted in order to maximize the time step. The method works independently of the underlying spatial mesh; therefore, it can be easily integrated into structured or unstructured codes. The additional computational cost is minimal, and a significant increase of the time step is achieved without losing accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated on both a Cartesian staggered and an unstructured collocated formulation. In practice, CPU cost reductions up to more than 4 with respect to the conventional approach have been measured.},

Under the above circumstances, the application of modeling tools/correlations based on small-diameter pipes in predicting flow behavior (flow pattern, void fraction, and pressure gradient) poses severe challenges in terms of accuracy.

abstract = {In this study, the influence of a drag-reducing polymer on oil-water flow patterns and pressure gradients was investigated in a downward-inclined pipe (-5??) and compared with the results obtained in a horizontal pipe for the same flow characteristics. Drag reduction was achieved by adding 40. ppm of polymer into an oil-water flow in an acrylic pipe of 0.0306. m ID flowing at 0.1-1.6. m/s mixture velocities and 0.05-0.9 input oil volume fractions. The downward inclination enhanced the mixing of the two phases and hence the boundaries between the dispersed and separated flows occurred at lower mixture velocities in downward flow than in horizontal flow. In both pipe orientations, the addition of the DRP affects the flow patterns and pressure gradients mainly in the water-dominated flow regions. Compared with those of the horizontal flow, the effect of polymer addition on flow pattern boundaries was generally lower at -5?? inclination. The effect of the polymer on the pressure gradients was more pronounced at horizontal flow than at -5?? flow, resulting in a maximum drag reduction of 64{\%} and 55{\%} at horizontal and -5?? flows, respectively. Since the polymer used is water-soluble, there were no observable changes in the flow characteristics at the oil-dominated flow regions.},

The mass and momentum conservation equations of slug and annular flows were obtained. Then the evaluation criterion of flow pattern transitions were established, including dispersed flow to slug flow, bubble flow to slug flow and slug flow to annular flow. The model prediction results were compared under the experimental conditions from the previous literatures. The predictions of flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient were compared between the new model and the pipe flow model modified by using the hydraulic diameter. The results show that the flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient can be predicted by the new model more accurately, and the prediction of liquid holdup and pressure gradient are better. ?? 2014 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration {\&} Development, PetroChina.},

The new VLES model is developed in this paper to overcome some of the apparent deficiencies of RANS and LES. The CLSVOF method, which combined the LS and VOF methods, was proposed by Sussman and Puckett. Two filling levels, 18.3{\%} and 43.7{\%}, are considered in the present analysis. Some complicated sloshing phenomena, including the plunging wave breaking, wave impact on the sidewall and the roof and the beating phenomenon can be observed in the present sloshing cases. The computational velocity fields, wave profiles and pressure data are compared with experimental results from Delorme and Souto–Iglesias. It must be emphasized that the analysis of the velocity amplitude and the free surface evolution are mainly focused on non-breaking wave and violent breaking wave, respectively. The specific objectives are: to evaluate the performance of the CLSVOF method and VLES model for modelling of liquid sloshing; (ii) to investigate the influence of interface capturing method and turbulence model on sloshing simulation results. This study will demonstrate that, contrary to the commonly held view, turbulence modelling and free surface tracking in violent and non–violent sloshing simulation play a dominant role and a secondary role, respectively.},

Owing to the uncertainties entangled with the scale law transforming the measured impact pressure up to the full scale one, so called comparative approach was taken to derive the design sloshing load. The target design vessel was chosen as 230 K LNG-FPSO with tow-row tank arrangement and the reference vessel as 138 K conventional LNG carrier, which has past track record without any significant failure due to sloshing loads. Starting with the site-specific metocean data, ship motion analysis was carried out with 3D diffraction-radiation program, then the obtained ship motion data was used as 6DOF tank excitation for subsequent sloshing model test and analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out with obtained peak data and the long-term sloshing load was determined out of it. It was concluded that the normalized sloshing impact pressure on 230 K LNG-FPSO with two-row tank arrangement is higher than that of convectional LNG carrier, hence requires the use of reinforced cargo containment system for the sake of failure-free operation without filling limitation.},

We show that, in the absence of diffusive forces, the system of conservation laws describing the flow is not necessarily hyperbolic. We present an example in which there is an elliptic region in saturation space for reasonable relative permeability data. Alinearized analysis shows that in nonhyperbolic regions solutions grow exponentially. However, the nonhyperbolic region, if present, will be of limited extent which inherently limits the exponential growth. To examine these nonlinear effects we resort to fine grid numerical experiments with a suitably dissipative numerical method. These experiments indicate that the solutions of Riemann problems remain well behaved in spite of the presence of a linearly unstable elliptic region in saturation space. In particular, when initial states are outside the elliptic region the Riemann problem solution appears to stay outside the region. Furthermore, stable shocks are formed connecting states inside the nonhyperbolic regions with states outside.},

abstract = {A modified version of the projection scheme [19] is proposed, which does not show a lower limit for the time step in contrast to the limits of stability observed numerically for some projection type schemes. An advantage of the proposed scheme is that the right-hand side of the Poisson equation for the pressure is independent of the time step. An explicit version of the current scheme is also provided besides the implicit-explicit one. For the implicit-explicit version, we retain divergence of the viscous terms on the right-hand side of the Poisson equation in order to achieve a higher accuracy for low Reynolds number flows. In this way, we also ensure that the Poisson equation with Neumann boundary condition is consistent on the discrete level, where we discretize the boundary condition as well. The spatial discretization is performed for equal and mixed orders of the velocity and pressure using the dG method. Long-term stability and optimal temporal and spatial convergence rates are obtained for the unsteady Taylor vortex and periodic channel flows. An excellent agreement with the similarity solution is achieved for the steady plane stagnation point flow. Finally, the current projection scheme is compared with the original one for a more complex coupled electro-fluid-dynamics problem. For the same numerical settings, the current scheme appears to be more accurate in predicting the expected physical behavior and it is long-term stable while the original scheme fails.},

The model is based on a two-phase approach, in which each phase is treated separately and interactions between the phases are considered explicitly. The macroscopic transport equations for each phase are derived using the technique of volumetric averaging. The basic forms of the constitutive relations are developed. These relations link the macroscopic transport phenomena to microscopic processes such as microstructure development, interfacial stresses, and interfacial heat and mass transfer. Thermodynamic relations are presented, and it is shown that nonequilibrium effects can be addressed within the framework of the present model. Various simplifications of the model are examined, and future modeling needs are discussed. 1991 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Material Society.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a Grid Convergence Index (GCI) for the uniform reporting of grid refinement studies in Computational Fluid Dynamics. The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a "nearby" problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.},

abstract = {We propose a method for quantifying the effective numerical dissipation rate and effective numerical viscosity in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Different from previous approaches that were formulated in spectral space, the proposed method is developed in a physical-space representation and allows for determining numerical dissipation rates and viscosities locally, that is, at the individual cell level, or for arbitrary subdomains of the computational domain. The method is self-contained and uses only the results produced by the Navier-Stokes solver being investigated. As no further information is required, it is suitable for a straightforward quantification of numerical dissipation as a post-processing step. We demonstrate the method's capabilities on the example of implicit large-eddy simulations of a three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex flow, serving as a test flow going through laminar, transitional, and turbulent stages of time evolution. For validation, we compare results for the effective numerical dissipation rate with exact reference data we obtained with an accurate, spectral-space approach.},

The key idea lies at the approximation level, where a nonlinear adaptive procedure is used to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, hence avoiding crossing discontinuities in the interpolation procedure as much as possible. ENO and WENO schemes have been quite successful in applications, especially for problems containing both shocks and complicated smooth solution structures, such as compressible turbulence simulations and aeroacoustics.

abstract = {The violent motion (sloshing) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in cargo tanks has attracted significant attention. Transformations of the LNG market have led to the increased transport of LNG in partially filled tanks, but established technology is mainly based on engineering experience with completely filled containers. This paper investigates a large sample of sloshing pressure measurements. It focuses on the magnitude of individual sloshing impact events, and their associated temporal and spatial patterns. The durations of these impacts are comparable to the natural frequency of an LNG container wall, so the details of their time histories are important in determining the structural response. Experiments are performed on tanks with high (92.5{\%}) and low (30{\%}) filling levels, for various wave headings. The common post-processing approach of representing impact pressure histories by a triangular profile is studied, and an alternative approach is presented. Two statistical models are used to describe the distribution of maximal pressures in sloshing impacts: a three-parameter Weibull model and a generalized Pareto model. The latter is found to be of questionable utility due to small sample sizes. It is observed that for low filling levels the sloshing impacts are of greater magnitude, having longer durations, smaller ratios of rise time to duration, and larger spatial extents. All these factors should in principle increase the structural response. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To study wind farm aerodynamics (WFA), the Wind Power industry currently relies on simple Engineering Models (EM) that simulate wind farms using basic principles of physics and empirically established approximations. EMs are fast and accurate for an overview of WFA and gauging mean power production, but cannot resolve phenomena like wake meandering, effect of atmospheric stratification on wake development, a turbine's response to partial wake interaction and yawed inflows etc., and their relation with turbine loading, which require a first principle physics-based model, namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although advances in computer technology have promoted the application of CFD, the study of WFA is yet unworkable with Direct Numerical Simulation, which is the most comprehensive CFD technique. Thus, as a trade-off between cost and detail, researchers must resort to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to garner thorough knowledge of WFA, which could in succession help the industry improve engineering models. This paper summarises the contributions of various LES investigations into WFA and how they have helped broaden our understanding of the subject. Additionally, the article touches upon the optimal use of LES and of the resultant data, and also the challenges faced by LES.},

abstract = {A new approach to chemistry modeling for large eddy simulation of turbulent react- ing flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modeling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Presently, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent-of-reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which de- scribe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast chemistry and steady flamelet models for predicting ve- locity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fueled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data and sig- nificantly outperform the fast chemistry and steady flamelet models, which both predict an attached flame. –},

abstract = {Minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are a class of sub-filter models for large-eddy simulation that give the minimum eddy dissipation required to dissipate the energy of sub-filter scales. A previously derived minimum-dissipation model is the QR model. This model is based on the invariants of the resolved rate-of-strain tensor and has many desirable properties. It appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flows, has low computational complexity, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on isotropic grids. However, the QR model proposed in the literature gives insufficient eddy dissipation. It is demonstrated that this can be corrected by increasing the model constant. The corrected QR model gives good results in simu- lations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid. On anisotropic grids the QR model is not consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor and requires an approximation of the filter width. It is demonstrated that the results of the QR model on anisotropic grids are primarily determined by the used filter width approximation, and that no approximation gives satisfactory results in simulations of both a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. A new minimum-dissipation model for anisotropic grids is proposed. This anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model generalizes the desirable practical and theoretical properties of the QR model to anisotropic grids and does not require an approximation of the filter width. TheAMDmodel is success- fully applied in simulations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid and in simulations of a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow on anisotropic grids.},

@article{Verstappen2016b,
abstract = {This paper is about models for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow that truncate the small scales of motion for which numerical resolution is not available by making sure that they do not get energy from the larger, resolved, eddies. The resolved scales are defined with the help of a box filter. The eddy dissipation is determined in such a way that the production of too small, box-fitting, scales is counteracted. This dissipation-production balance is worked out with the help of Poincar{\'{e}}'s inequality, which results in a condition that depends on the invariants of the velocity gradient. If the filter box is anisotropic the truncation condition is to be scaled in order to account for the anisotropy in the right way. The scaled truncation condition is applied to an eddy-viscosity model. This model is discretized and equipped with a Schumann filter. It is successfully tested for homogeneous turbulence as well as for turbulent channel flow.},

In this paper we present several partitioned procedures for time-integrating this focus coupled problem and discuss their merits in terms of accuracy, stability, heterogeneous computing, I/O transfers, subcycling and parallel processing. All theoretical results are derived for a one-dimensional piston model problem with a compressible flow, because the complete three-dimensional aeroelastic problem is difficult to analyze mathematically. However, the insight gained from the analysis of the coupled piston problem and the conclusions drawn from its numerical investigation are confirmed with the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional transient aeroelastic response of a flexible panel in a transonic non-linear Euler flow regime. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The use of simulation-based uncertainty propagation approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation method) can be computationally expensive if evaluating the function requires a relatively large computation time. To reduce the computation time, uncertainty propagation methods that use surrogate models (e.g., the Kriging method) may be used. In this paper, we extend the Kriging method to propagate the uncertainties from multiple sources, and for cases where the distribution of the prediction is produced at each trial (replication) of the simulation-based uncertainty propagation approach (i.e., at each sample point). The outputs of the methodology are the approximate percentiles of the output distribution. The capability of the methodology is tested using a Case Study involving the transport of solid particles in pipelines to prevent solid particle deposition and improve pipeline efficiency. Statistical comparisons suggest that our methodology successfully replicates the outputs from the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 94{\%} reduction in computational cost.},

@article{Sarica2011a,
abstract = {Slug flow is one of the common flow patterns in gas and oil production and transportation. One of the closure relationships required by the multiphase flow mechanistic models is slug length correlation. There are several closure relationships proposed in the literature as function of pipe geometry, pipe diameter, and inclination angle, and to a lesser extent to the flow rates and fluid properties. In this paper, we show that most of the frequently used mechanistic models are insensitive to slug length information. The only exception to this is identified as the Zhang  (2003, “Unified Model for Gas-Liquid Pipe Flow via Slug Dynamics—Part 1: Model Development,” ASME J. Energy Resour. Technol., 125 , pp. 266–272). The unified model shows sensitivity at high gas flow rates, while displaying a negligible sensitivity at low gas flow rates. In conclusion, the slug length closure relationship is not crucial for pressure loss and holdup calculations. It can be speculated that the success of the unit cell slug flow modeling approach could be attributed to insensitivity of the models to slug length considering the highly probabilistic nature of the slug length.},

@article{Soepyan2013a,
abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to introduce a methodology for determining the models that predict accurate threshold velocities for solid particle transport in a pipeline at a given operating condition. Methods: The proposed methodology consists of: (1) a data clustering approach that selects the data points from the experimental database that best represent the specified operating condition; (2) a model parameter fine-tuning module that adjusts the parameters of the models using the selected data to increase the models' accuracy within the range of the operating condition; and (3) a model ranking approach that uses statistical analyses to determine the appropriate models for the operating condition. Results: This methodology is validated using 164 experimental data points for horizontal (or near-horizontal), solid/liquid flow at low particle concentrations as operating conditions. The methodology generates underestimates of the threshold velocity for 38{\%} of the above-mentioned operating conditions, compared to 45{\%} for the Mantz (1977) model and 52{\%} for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model; and produces velocity predictions exceeding??50{\%} of the experimental velocity for only 10{\%} of the operating conditions, compared to 27{\%} for the Mantz (1977) model and 35{\%} for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model. Conclusion: The proposed methodology improves the accuracy of threshold velocity predictions compared to using conventional models. Practice implications: Initiating the motion of solid particles from the bottom of horizontal pipelines at low particle concentrations has been a topic of interest due to the desire to prevent the accumulation of solid particles in pipes. In order to initiate the movement of the particles, the magnitude of the velocity of the single-phase fluid must be equal to at least that of the threshold velocity for particle motion. There are multiple models that predict the threshold velocity, but for the same operating condition, the velocity estimations of these models might differ by orders of magnitude. Therefore, at a given operating condition, it is necessary to determine the models that best predict the threshold velocity. The methodology proposed in this paper successfully identifies the most accurate models to use at a given operating condition. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The one-dimensional water faucet problem is one of the classical benchmark problems originally proposed by Ransom to study the two-fluid two-phase flow model. With simplifications, such as massless gas phase and no wall and interfacial frictions, analytical solutions had been previously obtained for the transient liquid velocity and void fraction distribution. The water faucet problem and its analytical solutions have been widely used for code assessment, benchmark, and numerical verification. In this work, we present a new set of analytical solutions to the water faucet problem at the steady-state condition, with the gas-phase density's effect on pressure distribution considered. This new set of analytical solutions is used in a rigorous numerical verification process from which the anticipated second-order spatial accuracy is achieved for a second-order spatial discretization scheme. On the contrary, the same anticipated order of accuracy could not be obtained using the Ransom solutions as the reference. In addition, extended Ransom transient solutions for the gas-phase velocity and pressure are derived with the assumption of decoupled liquid and gas pressures. Numerical benchmark on the extended Ransom solutions is also presented.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine preservice elementary school teachers' geometry learning as investigated by both qualitative and quantitative methods. For the qualitative investigation, narrative analysis and thematic analysis methods were used. The findings of narrative analysis indicated two main kinds of stories: as a learner and as a beginning teacher. The thematic analysis findings yield to three themes: history of learning geometry, perceptions about geometry, effective geometry instructional practices. The findings informed the quantitative investigation on geometry content knowledge for the case of quadrilaterals. During the second phase of the study, 102 participants who enrolled in the methods course completed pre and post test of teachers' geometry content knowledge. Treatment group participants (n=54) received series of activities (geometry activities and student work analysis) focusing on quadrilaterals, and control group participants (n=48) received traditional instruction. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed a significant change in treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge. The mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of knowledge but no significant interaction between geometry content knowledge and grouping. Even though treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge growth was significant, the difference between treatment group and control group participants' growth in geometry content knowledge was not significant. This study informs mathematics teacher education in three important areas; limited knowledge of preservice teachers' geometry content knowledge, integrating mathematics content and the context of teaching into methods course, and use of student work with preservice teachers.},

abstract = {The onset of slugging in horizontal pipes has been analysed by a new approach. The relation between the appearance of waves on the stratified film, the formation of slugs and the transition to stable slug flow has been quantitatively examined. A new, necessary but not sufficient criterion for the transition to "stable" slug flow has been derived from an initial condition of slug growth. It reflects the well-known fact that waves of all kinds may form, even leading to liquid bridging of the pipe, but that the resulting slugs decay over a wide range of flow rates. In general, for slug flow to develop, an unstable film flow situation with waves is necessary, in addition to a condition allowing slugs, once formed, to grow initially. It is further shown, by comparisons with large-scale, high-pressure data from the SINTEF Two-phase Flow Laboratory, that this criterion for slug growth is the more restrictive, and may in practice be applied alone for the transitions from stratified or annular flow to slug flow, or even to dispersed bubble flow for high-pressure systems. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Linear stability of horizontal gas-liquid stratified flow was solved using a tau spectral method that is valid for all wavenumbers. Pressures of 0.1-10 atm and liquid viscosities of 1-600 cP were examined. Comparison of these results with Kelvin-Helmholtz, integral momentum and rigorous long wave expansion approaches indicates that the approximate models do not correctly predict the point of neutral stability. The discrepancies in the models are due to more than differences in the calculation of interfacial perturbation stress components and differences in the base states. Stability predictions that include gas phase turbulence, as modeled with either a polynomial velocity profile or with imposed boundary conditions obtained from measured pressure and shear stress variations, are similar to laminar results if the interfacial stress and liquid depth are the same. The long wave stability boundary is found to correlate well for different channel height, density ratio and viscosity ratio, using a gas superficial Froude number corrected with a square root of density ratio and a liquid superficial Froude number. For gas-liquid channel flow waves that grow fastest typically have dimensionless wavenumbers of order unity. Their growth rate scales as a corrected gas Reynolds number to the first power. If the gas-liquid depth ratio is less than approximately one, long waves can be unstable before moderate wavelength waves. Under conditions where unstable moderate wavelength waves appear within a couple of meters, it can take 20-50 times this length for slowly growing long wavelength waves, which can destroy regime stability, to appear. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {Multiphase computational fluid dynamics plays a major role in design and optimization of fossil fuel based reactors. There is a growing interest in accounting for the influence of uncertainties associated with physical systems to increase the reliability of computational simulation based engineering analysis. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has recently undertaken an initiative to characterize uncertainties associated with computer simulation of reacting multiphase flows encountered in energy producing systems such as a coal gasifier. The current work presents the preliminary results in applying non-intrusive parametric uncertainty quantification and propagation techniques with NETL's open-source multiphase computational fluid dynamics software MFIX. For this purpose an open-source uncertainty quantification toolkit, PSUADE developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has been interfaced with MFIX software. In this study, the sources of uncertainty associated with numerical approximation and model form have been neglected, and only the model input parametric uncertainty with forward propagation has been investigated by constructing a surrogate model based on data-fitted response surface for a multiphase flow demonstration problem. Monte Carlo simulation was employed for forward propagation of the aleatory type input uncertainties. Several insights gained based on the outcome of these simulations are presented such as how inadequate characterization of uncertainties can affect the reliability of the prediction results. Also a global sensitivity study using Sobol' indices was performed to better understand the contribution of input parameters to the variability observed in response variable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For a constant flow rate of liquid and gas in a pipe one expects the conditions along the pipe to be of a steady state nature. However, for a pipe in a hilly terrain or in an offshore pipeline-riser system, a steady state operation is often not possible, and conditions of severe or terrain slugging develop. This causes the system to operate in an undesired cyclic fashion in which alternate long liquid slugs are followed by the production of high gas flow rate. The present work deals with the condition under which steady state operation is possible. It shows theoretically that it is possible to stablize the flow by increasing the back pressure of the separator or by employing a controlled choking at the pipe exit. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The gas/liquid two-phase flow in pipeline/wavy-pipe/riser systems was investigated numerically with CFD. A CFD model of the pipeline/wavy-pipe/riser system was obtained by adding a wavy pipe to the model of the pipeline/riser system verified by the experimental data previously. The effects of the geometrical parameters and location of the wavy pipe on its performance of slug mitigation and flow characteristics in pipeline/wavy-pipe/riser systems were examined through the CFD models. With the increase of the amplitude or length of the wavy pipe, the slug in the pipeline/riser system becomes shorter. The optimum location of the wavy pipe in the pipeline exists for a pipeline/riser system and a wavy pipe at given operating conditions. The CFD modelling provides a feasible and flexible way to investigate the effectiveness of the wavy pipes on mitigating severe slugging in pipeline/riser systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Dressler1949b,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to obtain solutions which are periodic with respect to distance, describing the phenomenon called “roll-waves,” for water flow along a wide inclined channel, and to discuss the behavior of the mathematical solutions. The basic idea presented in Part I is that discontinuous periodic solutions can be constructed by joining together sections of a continuous solution through shocks (or “bores”). It is shown first that no continuous solutions can be periodic and that only one special continuous solution can be used as the basis for constructing discontinuous periodic solutions. The analysis is based upon the non-linear partial differential equations of the “shallow water theory,” augmented by the Chezy formula to allow for turbulent resistance. The Bresse profile equation is obtained in a form applicable for progressing wave flows. Shock conditions are derived for the case of an arbitrary continuous channel bed and for a flow subject to a resisting force. The special continuous solution is explicitly obtained and analyzed. Branches of it are then joined together through shocks. It is proved that roll-waves cannot occur either if the resistance is zero or if the resistance exceeds a certain critical value. As the resistance decreases, the size of the waves decreases also; and if the resistance becomes too large, the profiles reverse their direction and can no longer be joined by shocks. This critical value is reached when the (dimensionless) resistance coefficient equals one-fourth the value of the channel slope. The presence of a resistance force which varies merely with velocity is not sufficient to permit the construction of periodic solutions; the resistance must also act in such a manner that it decreases as the water depth increases. The analysis proves that the ratio of wave height to wave length of roll-waves is always independent of the speed of the waves. Explicit expressions for water height and shock height as functions of wave length are derived. The investigation studies the static discharge rate as a function of the wave speed, and asymptotic formulas for the wave speed in terms of the average discharge rate are derived. Twelve sets of curves arc presented, based on the equations obtained here, to illustrate the quantitative behavior of roll-waves; these may be used to check this theory against observed data. For prescribed values of slope, resistance, and wave speed, there is a one-parameter family of roll-wave solutions. If the wave length is also prescribed, the solution will then be unique.},

abstract = {Particle deposition is a complex problem in oil fields which affects all aspects of petroleum production, processing, and transportation. Asphaltene deposition has been repeatedly reported in various oil fields with interest on how it impacts the development of a reservoir. In many of the reported cases, it has been indicated that asphaltene deposition damages the wellbore and production facilities more severely than the formation. A great deal of research has been conducted to study the phase behavior and dynamic aspect of asphaltene deposition. However, there is a lack of comprehensive integrated modeling of asphaltene deposition in the wellbore during the multiphase fluid flow. In this paper, we present an implementation of asphaltene precipitation and deposition models into a thermal, multiphase, multi-component wellbore simulator that can be coupled with a compositional reservoir simulator. A key contribution of this work is the development of a simulator for predicting the detrimental effects of asphaltene in a well. Simulation results can show where and when the presence of asphaltene particles severely damages the efficiency and the productivity of the wells. This prediction is highly crucial if it is aimed to control the well performance and to optimize productivity.},

abstract = {Two-phase flow occurs during the production of oil and gas in the wellbores. Modeling this phenomenon is important for monitoring well productivity and designing surface facilities. Since transient time period in the producing well is usually shorter than reservoir time steps, stabilized flow is assumed in the wellbore. As such, semi-steady state models are used for modeling wellbore dynamics. However, in the case that flow variations occur in a short period of time (i.e., gas kick during drilling) the use of a transient two-phase model is crucial. A great deal of research has been conducted to study transient two-phase flow in wellbores. However, there is lack of a comprehensive two-fluid model in the petroleum literature. In this paper, we present an implementation of a pseudocompositional, thermal, fully implicit, transient two-fluid model for two-phase flow in wellbores. In this model, we solve gas/liquid mass balance, gas/liquid momentum balance, and two-phase energy balance equations to obtain five primary variables: liquid velocity, gas velocity, pressure, holdup, and temperature. This simulator can be used as a stand-alone code or can be used in conjunction with a reservoir simulator to mimic wellbore/reservoir dynamic interactions. In our model, we consider stratified, bubbly, intermittent and annular flow regimes using appropriate closure relations for inter-phase and wall shear stress terms in the momentum equations. In our simulation, we found that the inter-phase and wall shear stress terms for different flow regimes can significantly affect the model's results. In addition, the inter-phase momentum transfer terms mainly influence the holdup value. The outcome of this research leads to a more accurate simulation of multiphase flow in the wellbore and pipes, which can be applied to the surface facility design, well performance optimization, and wellbore damage estimation.},

The data shows that all the turbulent flow results may be correlated by the same expression regardless of the value of the slug liquid Reynolds number. This correlation is employed within a model adapted for horizontal flow that assumes a random distribution of slug lengths at the pipe entrance and calculates the evolution of the slug length distribution along a pipe. The results of the model are compared against experimentally determined slug length distributions obtained in a 16 m long pipe. The comparison between the calculated and observed average slug length is shown to be quite good over a range of flow rates and the overall shape of the length distributions is predicted well by the model.

abstract = {Prediction of the liquid level in stratified two-phase upwards flow shows that one may have multiple solutions. In this case it is necessary to determine which solutions will actually occur and whether hysteresis is possible, namely whether it is possible to have two or more solutions for the same operating conditions. In this work the stability of the solutions for stratified flow is considered using two types of stability analyses: (1) structural stability analysis; and (2) interfacial stability analysis (Kelvin-Helmholtz, K-H). For the K-H stability analysis we used two methods: an approximate simplified method suggested by Taitel {\&} Dukler; and a more rigorous method suggested by Barnea, which is based on a combination of the viscous K-H and inviscid K-H analyses. The results show that whenever three solutions exist only the first, i.e. the solution with the thinnest liquid level, is stable. The middle solution is always structurally unstable (linearly), whereas the third solution is structurally unstable to large disturbances (non-linear stability). The third solution is usually also unstable to the K-H type of instability. As a result it is concluded that hysteresis is not possible and that only the thinnest solution will be observed practically. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The prediction of the pressure drop gradient and the evaluation of the drag reduction phenomenon observed during the piping multiphase flow of a lubricating grease/air mixture have been investigated. With this aim, viscous flow tests in rotational rheometers and pressure drop measurements in pipelines have been carried out using different geometries with both smooth and rough surfaces. The Sisko model has been used to predict the pressure drop gradient. The drag ratio, as a function of air flow rate, for highly viscous pastes such as lubricating greases, significantly differs, qualitative and quantitatively, from that found in the literature for other non-Newtonian fluids with viscosities of around 200 times lower. The pressure drop gradient in the intermittent multiphase flow regime can be predicted by modifying the classical approach of Lockhart and Martinelli with an empirical correction factor. An empirical model, with a combination of power-law and sigmoidal-type equations, has been proposed to describe the experimental evolution of the drag ratio as a function of ReL???/ReTP???. The accuracy of the proposed model has been tested by estimating the classical Fanning friction factor for a non-Newtonian fluid, f = 16/Re???, once the pressure loss has been corrected with the drag ratio previously obtained. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We consider the motion of a deformable interface that separates a fully-developed tur- bulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid.We outline a linear model to describe the interaction between the turbulent gas flow and the interfacial waves. This approach includes two steps. First, we derive a flat-interface base state. This comprises a velocity profile that takes account of the laminar sublayer present in the near-interfacial region of the gas, and a method for determining the wall and interfacial shear stresses as a function of the mean pressure gradient. The second step involves an Orr–Sommerfeld analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and necessitates the selection of a turbulent-stress closure scheme. This approach permits us to determine numeri- cally the growth rate of the wave amplitude, as a function of the relevant dimensionless system parameters and turbulence closure relations. It also extends previous work by accounting for the effects of the thin liquid layer on the dynamics. The inclusion of this feature has a startling effect: by a judicious choice of viscosity or density contrast, or of surface-roughness parameter, we observe mode competition, in which the maximum growth rate of the instability derives its energy from internal effects in the liquid layer, rather than from interfacial effects. We have also classified the observed waves either as ‘fast' or ‘slow', and compared our results with experimental data: excellent agreement is obtained in the slow-wave case, while only qualitative agreement is obtained for faster waves. This is consistent with our demonstration that the stationary turbulence model used is valid only for slow waves.},

abstract = {We derive a flat-interface model to describe the flow of two horizontal, stably stratified fluids, where the bottom layer exhibits non-Newtonian rheology. The model takes into account the yield stress and power-law nature of the bottom fluid. In the light of the large viscosity contrast assumed to exist across the fluid interface, and for large pressure drops in the streamwise direction, the possibility for the upper Newtonian layer to display fully developed turbulence must be considered, and is described in our model. We develop a linear-stability analysis to predict the conditions under which the flat-interface state becomes unstable, and pay particular attention to characterizing the influence of the non-Newtonian rheology on the instability. Increasing the yield stress (up to the point where unyielded regions form in the bottom layer) is destabilizing; increasing the flow index, while bringing a broader spectrum of modes into play, is stabilizing. In addition, a second mode of instability is found, which depends on conditions in the bottom layer. For shear-thinning fluids, this second mode becomes more unstable, and yet more bottom-layer modes can become unstable for a suitable reduction in the flow index. One further difference between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases is the development of unyielded regions in the bottom layer, as the linear wave on the interface grows in time. These unyielded regions form in the trough of the wave, and can be observed in the linear analysis for a suitable parameter choice. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The predictions of the pre-integrated model are validated showing a good agreement when compared with experimental data. The criteria for the transition from the stratified flow pattern are applied to gas/non-Newtonian stratified flow. The neutral stability analysis (smooth/wavy stratified flow) and the well-posedness (existence region of stratified flow) of governing equations are carry out. The predicted transition boundaries are obtained using the steady fully developed two-fluid model and the pre-integrated model, where the shape factors and their derivatives are accounted for.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to phenomenologically investigate the parameters controlling slug frequency in horizontal two-phase pipe flow and to develop a predictive empirical correlation. In this study, two aspects governing slug frequency are investigated, namely the slug initiation mechanism at the pipe entrance region (entrance effect) and the flow development along the pipe (pipe length effect). Experimental results show that fully developed slugs generated under the hydrodynamic slugging mechanism have lower frequency than those generated under the terrain slugging mechanism for high Froude number conditions (NFr {\textgreater} 3). Conversely, fully developed slugs generated under the terrain slugging mechanism have frequency greater than those generated under hydrodynamic slugging frequency in low Froude number conditions (NFr {\textless} 3). Although the effect of the flow development along the pipe on slug frequency is a controversial issue in the literature, experimental data show its irrelevance to slug frequency over a wide range of operational conditions. However, experimental results show slug frequency decline along a pipeline in the case of very high liquid flow rate and very low gas flow rate and vice versa. Based on the understanding of the related physical parameters to slug frequency, a new slug frequency correlation is developed using a broad range experimental database. The developed multiple linear correlation accounts for 92{\%} of the variation in the slug frequency in the experimental data. A validation study of the new correlation against an independent data set revealed an average error and standard deviation of 35{\%} and 68{\%}, respectively. A tuned version of the model using the model statistical coefficients' confidence intervals revealed improved validation results of 19{\%} average percent error (outperforming existing correlations) and 62{\%} standard deviation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The reservoir fluids are very dry and the pipeline flow is typically low liquid loading conditions at which multiple holdup solutions exist. Previous experience has shown that the OLGA model is not predicting well at these conditions and that very little experimental data exist for such conditions. Hence the experimental “Large Scale Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests” campaign was carried out at the SINTEF Tiller large scale test facility, followed up by the “Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study” with Schlumberger SPTC. This presentation gives an overview of the Tanzania deep water gas development with focus on the flow assurance challenges relates to a Subsea to Beach concept. The background, motivation and scope of work for the two studies “Large Scale Low Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests (SINTEF)” and “Tanzania Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study” (Schlumberger SPTC) are given, while the results are presented in detail in separate presentations. Introduction The Tanzania Gas Project (TGP) is located in Block 2 approximately 100km offshore Tanzania in East Africa (ref Figure 1). Statoil Tanzania AS is the operator in Block 2 with 65{\%} interest with ExxonMobil as a partner with 35{\%} interest. Locations of the Block 2 discoveries are shown in Figure 1. The objective of the project is to develop the core area of Block 2 by producing gas offshore, transporting it to shore and feeding an onshore Joint Venture (JV) Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant. The onshore JV is between the operators of Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. BG Group (BG) is the operator of Blocks 1, 3 and 4. As of 1Q 2015, eight reservoirs have been discovered in Block 2: Zafarani, Lavani Main, Lavani Deep, Tangawizi, Mronge, Mdalasini, Giligiliani and Piri. This paper gives an overview of the Tanzania deep water gas development with a focus on the flow assurance challenges relating to a Subsea to Beach concept, and then especially related to multiphase flow modelling. The reservoir fluids are very dry and the pipeline flow is typically low liquid loading conditions at which multiple holdup solutions exist. Experience has shown that the “standard” OLGA model is not predicting well at these conditions (ref Figure 11) and that very little experimental data exist for such conditions. The background, motivation and scope of work for the two studies “Large Scale Low Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests (SINTEF)” and Tanzania Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study (Schlumberger SPTC) are given, whilst the results are presented in detail in separate papers (ref /14/, /15/, /16/ and /17/), each presenting in detail the studies that have been carried out as part of the Tanzania flow model verification work.},

@article{Kadri2009b,
abstract = {Long liquid slugs, with sizes reaching 500 pipe diameters or more, may form in gas-liquid horizontal pipe flow at intermediate liquid loadings. Such slugs cause serious operational upsets due to the strong fluctuations in flow supply and pressure. Therefore, predicting the transition from short (hydrodynamic) to long slug flow regimes may play a significant role in preventing or reducing the negative effects caused by the long slugs. In this paper we introduce a growth model for calculating the average slug length in horizontal and near horizontal pipes. The model applies a volumetric balance between the front and tail of the slug in order to calculate the slug growth rate. The dynamic behaviour of the liquid at the tail is described by a linear kinematic relation between the slug downstream and the wave upstream. For the validation of the model we performed measurements in a 137 m length air-water horizontal pipe flow of an internal diameter (i.d.) of 0.052 m. The measurements provide a detailed flow map of the long slug regime and sub-regimes. Furthermore, we compared predictions by the model with available data for a range of 0.019-0.095 m i.d. pipes to investigate the effect of varying operation pressures, different inlet conditions, different fluid properties and slight inclinations. The model predicted the transitions from hydrodynamic to long slugs with satisfactory agreements, however it underpredicts the average slug length at relatively large mixture velocities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In chemical and oil industry gas/shear-thinning liquid two-phase flows are frequently encountered. In this work, we investigate experimentally the flow characteristics of air/shear-thinning liquid systems in horizontal and slightly inclined smooth pipes. The experiments are performed in a 9-m-long glass pipe using air and three different carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solutions as test fluids. Flow pattern maps are built by visual observation using a high-speed camera. The observed flow patterns are stratified, plug, and slug flow. The effects of the pipe inclination and the rheology of the shear-thinning fluid in terms of flow pattern maps are presented. The predicted existence region of the stratified flow regime is compared with the experimental observation showing a good agreement. A mechanistic model valid for air/power-law slug flow is proposed and model predictions are compared to the experimental data showing a good agreement. Slug flow characteristics are investigated by the analysis of the signals of a capacitance probe: slug velocity, slug frequency, and slug lengths are measured. A new correlation for the slug frequency is proposed and the results are promising.},

abstract = {A mathematical model, numerical simulations and stability and flow regime maps corresponding to severe slugging in pipeline-riser systems, are presented. In the simulations air and water were used as flowing fluids. The mathematical model considers continuity equations for liquid and gas phases, with a simplified momentum equation for the mixture, neglecting inertia. A drift-flux model, evaluated for the local conditions in the riser, is used as a closure law. The developed model predicts the location of the liquid accumulation front in the pipeline and the liquid level in the riser, so it is possible to determine which type of severe slugging occurs in the system. The numerical procedure is convergent for different nodalizations. A comparison is made with experimental results corresponding to a catenary riser, showing very good results for slugging cycle and stability and flow regime maps. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The experiments were conducted using a horizontal 31. m long, D=10. cm internal diameter transparent pipe at atmospheric pressure. High resolution photography allowed the location of the gas-liquid interface to be measured with a high degree of accuracy at 5. Hz. Image analysis allowed individual waves to be tracked over a 14. D section of the pipe. Regular waves having similar properties such as speed, amplitude and length were seen far from the region of slug formation. However, near the transition region, where hydrodynamic slugs were formed, significant differences between wave properties were observed which resulted in wave interaction leading to a type of sub-harmonic resonance and slug formation. The formation of hydrodynamic slugs due to wave interaction differs from predictions for slug formation using long wavelength stability theory. The properties of the waves were quantified which gave detailed information on the resonance mechanism found near the transition to slugging. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The upstream offshore multi-phase well-pipeline-riser installations are facing huge challenges related to slugging flow: An unstable flow regime where the flow rates, pressures and temperatures oscillate in the multi-phase pipelines. One typical severe slug is induced by vertical wells or risers causing the pressure to build up and hence originates the oscillating pressure and flow. There exist many negative consequences related to the severe slugging flow and thus lots of investments and effort have been put into reducing or completely eliminating the severe slug. This paper reviews in details the state-of-the-art related to analysis, detection, dynamical modeling and elimination of the slug within the offshore oil {\&} gas Exploration and Production (E{\&}P) processes. Modeling of slugging flow has been used to investigate the slug characteristics and for design of anti-slug control as well, however most models require specific facility and operating data which, unfortunately, often is not available from most offshore installations. Anti-slug control have been investigated for several decades in oil {\&} gas industry, but many of these existing methods suffer the consequent risk of simultaneously reducing the oil {\&} gas production. This paper concludes that slug is a well defined phenomenon, but even though it has been investigated for several decades the current anti-slug control methods still have problems related to robustness. It is predicted that slug-induced challenges will be even more severe as a consequence of the longer vertical risers caused by deep-water E{\&}P in the future.},

The system of equations is rendered well-posed by interfacial pressure model for the riser. The selected flow conditions are restricted in the well-posed region for the horizontal and the downward inclined pipes to ensure the hydrodynamic slug characteristics are predicted correctly. The validity of the model is examined by water faucet problem and horizontal slug flow experiments. Simulations with and without slug capturing are conducted to address the effect of hydrodynamic slugs on severe slugging. It has been found that more accurate predictions are obtained by taking hydrodynamic slugs into account. At low superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to overestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream gas expansion is suppressed by the hydrodynamic slugs. At relatively high superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to underestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream compressible volume is greatly enlarged by the blowout of the hydrodynamic slugs. In both situations, the influences of the hydrodynamic slugs can reduce the errors of the predicted severe slugging characteristics.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of negative frictional pressure drop could occur in vertical two-phase flow in some conditions. At gas-liquid ratios ranging from 100 to 10,000, the two-phase flow in a liquid-loading gas well was experimentally simulated in a vertical pipe. The superficial gas velocities range from 0.1. m/s to 20. m/s and the superficial liquid velocities range from 0.00001. m/s to 0.2. m/s corresponding to the gas-liquid ratios. The negative frictional pressure drop was observed in this experiment. The uncertainty analysis shows that the negative frictional pressure drop could not be undoubtedly attributed to measurement error. Further investigation indicates that the energy loss is associated with a buoyancy-like term in addition to the frictional pressure drop in vertical two-phase flow. By taking this buoyancy-like term into account, the energy losses obtained from experimental data are all positive in the cases of negative frictional pressure drops. The results demonstrate the potential for the negative frictional pressure drop in which case the energy loss is positive and hence the rule of energy conversion is not violated in vertical two-phase flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study presents a Lagrangian slug tracking model for prediction of slug flow in multiphase flow pipelines. Simulations are compared with severe slugging experiments from the SINTEF Large Scale Multiphase Laboratory with 0.189??m inner diameter and a length of about 1000??m. The fluids used in the experiments are nitrogen and naphtha, and the system pressure is 25??bar. The model is shown to give fast and accurate results within the experimental accuracy without the need for a sub-grid model, as long as the grid size is not too large around the riser bottom where the liquid blockage occurs. It is also shown that simulations using a constant pressure boundary condition at the outlet are not always adequate, as the pressure fluctuations in the receiving facilities can significantly affect the flow. Furthermore, we show that the inclusion of a droplet field has a significant impact on the predicted slugging periods.},

This condition is central to the stability of hyperbolic relaxation systems, and is expected to hold for most such models describing natural phenomena. In this paper, we study a hierarchy of two-phase flow models. We consider relaxation with respect to volume transfer, heat transfer and mass transfer. We formally verify that our relaxation processes are consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and present analytical expressions for the wave velocities for each model in the hierarchy. Through an appropriate choice of variables, we prove directly by sums-of-squares that for all relaxation processes considered, the subcharacteristic condition holds for any thermodynamically stable equation of state.},

abstract = {For nuclear reactor safety analysis, the one-dimensional two-fluid model equations are solved numerically with the first order upwind method because of its robust stability. In the present two-fluid model for horizontal stratified flow, surface tension is included because it makes the model well-posed. However, this is not done in industrial applications and numerical viscosity provides linear stabilization even when the model is ill-posed. It is now shown that numerical viscosity also provides nonlinear stabilization; meaning that the wave growth is bounded when the flow is unstable (e.g., in case of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability). The formation of kinematic shocks in the presence of numerical viscosity provides the dissipation mechanism needed to stop the wave growth. However, numerical viscosity varies with the mesh size, which means that even though the unstable model is well-posed and meets von Neumann and nonlinear stabilization requirements, the solution does not converge for some short wavelengths greater than 2$\Delta$x. Furthermore, when the mesh size is large, significant artificial viscosity is added to the continuity and momentum equations and the model may become over-stabilized. A more scientific approach is proposed: to add a physical dissipation mechanism instead of numerical viscosity, i.e., Reynolds stresses. This approach has two advantages: first, the one-dimensional two-fluid model converges under severe dynamic conditions, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and second, a higher order numerical method may be used instead of the first order upwind scheme without experiencing numerical excursions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For fully-developed two-phase flows, maps that correlate experimental and semi-empirical expressions for flow regimes are widely used. For calculations of the various important two-phase flow parameters, this in turn requires correlations for various interfacial and wall interaction effects that are flow regime dependent. For many systems of practical interest, however, the evolution of flow regimes (such as slug flow in oil-gas pipelines) is of interest because the development lengths are long and flow regimes may change in regions where pipeline inclination changes due to the terrain. It is shown here that for slow transients in near-horizontal pipes, the one-dimensional multi-field model, when solved with sufficient resolution, does not require flow regimes to be specified or flow regime dependent closure relationships. The formulation predicts the development of flow regimes and various flow parameters without the need for maps, or the need to change closure relationships. To accomplish this, the model includes four fields, i.e. continuous and dispersed liquid, continuous and dispersed gas, as well as a set of appropriate closure relationships from the literature. For the main application considered here, i.e. slow transients in oil-gas pipelines, order of magnitude analyses indicate that certain inertial terms in the model are very small and can be neglected in comparison to the others. Advantage is taken of this to simplify both the structure of the mathematical problem and the solution procedure, which is sufficiently accurate that mass is conserved for each of the four fields. Furthermore, the calculations require high spatial resolution, so a fast, easily-parallelizable numerical procedure has been applied. The results indicate that the development of certain flow regimes, including transitions from bubbly to stratified flow and vice versa, slug flow including slug frequency and length, and the evolution of these parameters along a pipeline are well predicted by the model when compared to experimental data. As part of the validation it is also shown that the model predicts, without need to change closure relationships, flow regimes in fully-developed near-horizontal two-phase flows in good agreement with existing flow regime maps. This suggests that for slow transients in flows for which one-dimensional effects dominate, predictions can be made without requirements for flow regime maps and closure relationships that depend on them. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The two-fluid model is widely used in studying gas-liquid flow inside pipelines because it can qualitatively predict the flow field at low computational cost. However, the two-fluid model becomes ill-posed when the slip velocity exceeds a critical value, and computations can be quite unstable before the flow reaches the ill-posed condition. In this work, computational stability of various convection schemes together with the Euler implicit method for the time derivatives in conjunction with the two-fluid model is analyzed. A pressure correction algorithm for the two-fluid model is carefully implemented to minimize its effect on numerical stability. von Neumann stability analysis shows that the central difference scheme is more accurate and more stable than the 1st-order upwind, 2nd-order upwind, and QUICK schemes. The 2nd-order upwind scheme is much more susceptible to instability than the 1st-order upwind scheme and is inaccurate for short waves. Excellent agreement is obtained between the predicted and computed growth rates of harmonic disturbances. The instability associated with the two-fluid model discretized system of equations is related to but quantitatively different from the instability associated with ill-posedness of the two-fluid model. When the computation becomes unstable due to the ill-posedness, the machine roundoff errors from a selected range of short wavelengths, which scale with the grid size, are amplified rapidly to render the computation of any targeted long wavelength variation useless. For the viscous two-fluid model with wall friction and interfacial drag, a small-amplitude long wavelength disturbance grows due to viscous Kelvin-Helmholtz instability without triggering the grid scale short waves when the system remains well posed. Under such a condition, central difference is found to be the most accurate discretization scheme among those investigated. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The waves are treated in a similar way to slugs, modelled as objects moving at the wave velocity and with a pressure variation across them. The two-fluid model is solved on a stationary staggered grid in stratified sections between moving waves and slugs. The model is dynamic meaning that the growth and decay of waves and slugs can be simulated. The wave model implementation within the tracking scheme is discussed and demonstrated in comparison to existing experimental data on wave velocities and averaged pressure drops. The results from the tracking scheme compared well to the experiments when waves were initiated with the experimental frequency.

abstract = {The pigging operation is a common practice in the petroleum and gas industry. Pigging flow lines is employed for many reasons including cleaning deposits such as wax layers, the removal of liquids and condensate, the separation of products pumped one after the other in the same pipeline, measurement, and control and flow line inspection. In this paper, the mathematical modeling of the transient motion of a pig through liquid and gas pipelines is presented. For this purpose, the fluid flow equations were combined with a linear momentum equation for the pig. The nonlinear equations are solved under an unsteady state condition by the method of characteristics (MOC) with a regular rectangular grid through the pipeline under appropriate initial and boundary conditions. From this simulation, the pig position, optimum flow rate in upstream flow and the time that the pig reaches the end of the pipeline are obtained. Comparison of the simulation results with the field data of liquid flow through the pipeline from KG to AG located in Iran show that the derived mathematical models are effective for the prediction of position and pig velocity under the given operational conditions of a pipeline. Similar results are also obtained for gas flow through the pipeline from Nar-1 to Nar-2 located in Iran, in comparison with the field data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Pig is divided into a number of elements, Newton's second law is written for all the different elements of pig and then all the equations are added to get the dynamic equation of the pig's motion. An algorithm is used to solve the differential equation of the motion based on Runge-Kutta method. Continuity, momentum and the state equations are employed to achieve the gas flow parameters like density, velocity and pressure along the pipeline since the dynamic behavior of the pig depends on the flow field characteristics. It is assumed that pig is long and there is a bypass valve in pig's body. The path of the pig or geometry of the pipeline is considered as 2D curve. Numerical examples are chosen to show the application of the proposed formulation and algorithm.

abstract = {We study buoyant displacement flows with two miscible fluids of equal viscosity in the regime of low Atwood number and in ducts that are inclined close to horizontal. Using a combination of experimental, computational and analytical methods, we characterize the transitions in the flow regimes between inertial- and viscous-dominated regimes, and as the displacement flow rate is gradually increased. Three dimensionless groups largely describe these flows: densimetric Froude number {\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Fr{\}}{\$}, Reynolds number {\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Re{\}}{\$} and duct inclination {\$}\backslashensuremath{\{}\backslashbeta{\}} {\$}. Our results show that the flow regimes collapse into regions in a two-dimensional {\$}(\backslashmathit{\{}Fr{\}}, \backslashmathit{\{}Re{\}}\backslashcos \backslashensuremath{\{}\backslashbeta{\}} / \backslashmathit{\{}Fr{\}}){\$} plane. These regions are qualitatively similar between pipes and plane channels, although viscous effects are more extensive in pipes. In each regime, we are able to give a leading-order estimate for the velocity of the leading displacement front, which is effectively a measure of displacement efficiency.},

@article{Davies1950b,
abstract = {Part I describes measurements of the shape and rate of rise of air bubbles varying in volume from 1{\textperiodcentered} 5 to 200 cm.3 when they rise through nitrobenzene or water. Measurements of photographs of bubbles formed in nitrobenzene show that the greater part of the upper surface is always spherical. A theoretical discussion, based on the assumption that the pressure over the front of the bubble is the same as that in ideal hydrodynamic flow round a sphere, shows that the velocity of rise, U, should be related to the radius of curvature, R, in the region of the vertex, by the equation U = 2/3√ (gR); the agreement between this relationship and the experimental results is excellent. For geometrically similar bubbles of such large diameter that the drag coefficient would be independent of Reynolds's number, it would be expected that U would be proportional to the sixth root of the volume, V; measurements of eighty-eight bubbles show considerable scatter in the values of U/V1/6, although there is no systematic variation in the value of this ratio with the volume. Part II. Though the characteristics of a large bubble are associated with the observed fact that the hydrodynamic pressure on the front of a spherical cap moving through a fluid is nearly the same as that on a complete sphere, the mechanics of a rising bubble cannot be completely understood till the observed pressure distribution on a spherical cap is understood. Failing this, the case of a large bubble running up a circular tube filled with water and emptying at the bottom is capable of being analyzed completely because the bubble is not then followed by a wake. An approximate calculation shows that the velocity U of rise is U = 0{\textperiodcentered} 46 √ (ga), where a is the radius of the tube. Experiments with a tube 7{\textperiodcentered} 9 cm. diameter gave values of U from 29{\textperiodcentered} 1 to 30{\textperiodcentered} 6 cm./sec., corresponding with values of U/√ (ga) from 0{\textperiodcentered} 466 to 0{\textperiodcentered} 490.},

@article{Xu2011b,
abstract = {The study is motivated by the problem of pipeline corrosion due to water accumulation at low spots. Lab-scale experiments were conducted to identify the critical conditions required for the onset of water displacement by oil flow from a low horizontal section into an upward inclined section of the pipeline. Two test loops with pipe diameters of 27. mm and 41. mm I.D. with diesel flow were used. Water withdrawal from tapping valves distributed along the up-hill section enabled to follow the water displacement for oil flow rates exceeding the critical value.A model for predicting the water displacement by the oil flow, which is based on the formation of a water plug in the lowest (horizontal) section, is suggested. The predicted amounts of water withdrawn from the tapping valves favorably compare with the experimental results. Considering other competing mechanisms, up-scaling to larger pipe diameters is examined. The analysis indicates that water plug formation appears to be the controlling mechanism for water displacement also in larger pipe diameters encountered in field operations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Leung2015b,
abstract = {This paper describes the use of the Error-in-Variable Model (EVM), a type of parameter estimation techniques, for the determination of the internal pipe wall surface conditions (effective surface roughness) of pipe segments in complex natural gas pipeline networks and sub-lateral gathering networks. This technique uses SCADA data collected over a period of time such as pressures, temperatures and flow rates at boundary points of the network, i.e. at receipt and delivery points. These data are used as input to the EVM along with pertinent objective functions that are based on dimensional mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The main focus of the technique is to extract reliable and accurate information with regard to the internal wall surface condition of pipe segments within the network that are showing evidence of fouling or under-performing from the flow efficiency perspective. The EVM is most suited for this problem as it accounts for uncertainties in the SCADA data from errors in the measurement instrumentations, the time averaging processing of the data and the inherent assumption of the quasi-steadiness of the flow rates. Insight into the implication of pipe segments arranged in series or in parallel within the network is highlighted. Guidance as to the relationship between the number of necessary distinct data sets required for a given number of parameters (surface roughness of pipe segments) to be estimated and the number of independent objective functions that can be written for a given network is provided. Finally, the EVM technique is demonstrated by an existing sub-lateral natural gas receipt network feeding into a main gas transmission pipeline (DN750), 21.1km upstream of a compressor station.},

abstract = {This paper is my personal recollection tracing the most signal events in the history of the initiation, development, and propagation phases of multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which started in 1970. There are overlaps in the transitions from one phase to another. I define the initiation phase as beginning with Charles W. (Chuck) Solbrig in 1970 and ending roughly in 1975-1977 with the dissolution of the original SLOOP (seriated loop) code group. The development phase extends from 1977 to roughly 1992-1993. The propaga- tion phase extends from 1993 to the present. While not claiming to be definitive, this review has as its primary objective the documentation of some of its most significant milestones and events. The history of multiphase CFD is intimately and inextricably connected with a significant portion of the career of Professor Dimitri Gidaspow who is honored in this special issue of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research by colleagues, former students, and experts in the field of mul- tiphase flow, especially fluidization and solids transport. A very brief account from a different perspective was presented at “A Festschrift to Honor Professor Dimitri Gidaspow on His 65th Birthday” which I organized at the 33rd National Heat Transfer Conference, August 15-17, 1999, at the Hyatt Regency in Albuquerque, NM.1 Emphasis herein is on the initiation phase since it has not been formally documented previously, to my knowledge.},

Pressure, in situ liquid holdup, translational velocity and flow pattern changes were monitored at four measurement stations installed along the pipeline. An existing simplified model for predicting two-phase transient flow behavior that uses physically-based flow pattern-dependent mechanistic models has been modified and improved. The resulting set of differential equations is solved numerically utilizing a semi-implicit numerical scheme.

The Froude number is given as a function of the angle of inclination (O) and Eo in order to represent the effect of tube size, inclination angle, and fluid properties on the rise velocity of the bubble. As the angle of inclination from the horizontal increases, Fr increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases for all fluids. The maximum Fr value occurs at larger angles of inclination when the fluid is non-Newtonian. For Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids possessing similar values of surface tension and zero-shear rate viscosity, the Fr values are similar for vertical tubes.

abstract = {This paper presents a transient roll-wave simulator based on a one-dimensional incompressible two-fluid model. Using an efficient numerical method and a grid cell length of one pipe diameter, the simulator is able to accurately predict experimental data in the roll-wave regime. Essential to obtaining the stable roll-wave solutions is the use of a modified version of the Biberg friction model. Based on an algebraic eddy viscosity model, the Biberg model yields mechanistic expressions for the wall and interfacial shear stresses in stratified two-phase flow. Input to the model is closure relations for the turbulence levels at either side of the interface. In order to model the increased dissipation of energy in breaking wave fronts, we propose to modify the original closures by adding a term proportional to the negative gradient of the liquid height. As the waves grow and come close to breaking, this term redistributes the shear stresses such that the waves are stabilized. The numerical method used in the simulator is an extension of a previously presented pseudospectral Fourier method. In particular, spectral vanishing viscosity terms are introduced to stabilize short wavelengths inconsistent with the long wavelength approximation of the two-fluid model. The result is a simulator that provides reliable and convergent numerical solutions for all stratified flow conditions. In the last part of the paper, the simulator is tested against roll-wave experiments with horizontal and upward inclined flows of water and a dense gas in a 10 cm pipe. Wave heights and speeds as well as mean pressure drops and holdups are predicted within 20{\%} accuracy when compared with 474 experiments. Furthermore, the transient simulations enable us to study the dynamics and interactions between waves. In agreement with experimental observations, two different wave growth mechanisms are identified, and their influence on the evolution of the roll-wave flow regime is analyzed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in some basic investigations of properties of the relaxation schemes first introduced by Jin and Xin [1]. The main advantages of these schemes are that they neither require the use of Riemann solvers nor the computation of nonlinear flux Jacobians. This can be an important advantage when more complex models are considered where it is not possible to perform analytical calculations of Jacobians and/or when considering fluids with nonstandard equation of state. We apply the schemes (relaxing and relaxed) to a certain two-phase model where Jacobians cannot in general be calculated analytically. We first demonstrate that the original relaxation schemes of Jin and Xin produce a poor approximation for a typical mass transport example which involves transition from two-phase flow to single-phase flow. However, by introducing a slight modification of the original relaxation model by splitting the momentum flux into a mass and pressure part, we obtain some flux splitting relaxation schemes which for typical two-phase flow cases yield a more accurate and robust approximation.},

abstract = {Two-phase flows in pipelines occur in a variety of processes in the nuclear, petroleum and gas industries. Because of the practical importance of accurately predicting steady and unsteady flows along the line, two-fluid models have been extensively used in numerical simulations. These models are usually written as a system of non-linear partial-differential equations. A reliable prediction of such flows is a difficult task to accomplish due to the numerous sources of uncertainties, such as the basic two-phase flow model, the flow-pattern models, the initial and boundary conditions and the numerical method used to solve the initial-boundary-value problem. Several numerical methods, conservative or not, may be used to discretize the problem. In this paper we analyze the global performance of the numerical model, obtained when we couple a classical one-dimensional single-pressure four-equation two-fluid model to a numerical discretization based on the flux-corrected transport (FCT) method, to solve the stratified-pattern two-phase flow that occurs in typical gas-gathering offshore pipelines. The gas phase is considered to be compressible and the liquid phase is incompressible, whereas the flow is assumed to be isothermal. We show that the FCT method is second-order in space and that our numerical kernel produces accurate simulations for steady, as well as unsteady, simulations. We also analyze the hyperbolicity property of the two-fluid model and the adequate prescription of the boundary conditions. The results show that hyperbolicity is lost in part of the area of the stratified-pattern region of a classical flow-pattern diagram. Moreover, the eigenvalues alternate signs at the boundaries, which has implications on how to impose the boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of typical offshore gas pipeline flows show very good agreement when compared to a commercial software.},

The resulting growth rate is compared to that obtained from a stability analysis of the parent system of differential equations. It is shown that the discretization of the equations introduces a cutoff limit for short wavelengths, below which all the perturbations are damped. This is equivalent to rendering the system numerically well posed. It is suggested here that this effect, for practical sizes of the mesh, is sufficient to stabilize the system and to yield valid solutions that lead to the prediction of the initiation of slugs in vertical configurations, and hence the computations for intermittent vertical flow using the two-fluid model. Those computations have been validated in a companion paper against experimental data.},

abstract = {A Kalman filter based sequential estimator is presented in the present work. The estimator is integrated in the structure of segregated solvers for the analysis of incompressible flows. This technique provides an augmented flow state integrating available observation in the CFD model, naturally preserving a zero-divergence condition for the velocity field. Because of the prohibitive costs associated with a complete Kalman Filter application, two model reduction strategies have been proposed and assessed. These strategies dramatically reduce the increase in computational costs of the model, which can be quantified in an increase of {\$}10\backslash{\%} - 15\backslash{\%}{\$} with respect to the classical numerical simulation. In addition, an extended analysis of the behavior of the numerical model covariance {\$}Q{\$} has been performed. The results have shown that optimized values are strongly linked to the truncation error of the discretization procedure. The estimator has been applied to the analysis of a number of test cases exhibiting increasing complexity, including turbulent flow configurations. The results show that the augmented flow successfully improves the prediction of the physical quantities investigated, even when the observation is provided in a limited region of the physical domain. In addition, the present work indicates that these Data Assimilation techniques, which are at an embryonic stage of development in CFD, can be pushed even further using the augmented prediction as a powerful tool for the optimization of the free parameters in the numerical simulation.},

While the Squire's theorem (on the two-dimensionality of the critical disturbances) rigorously holds for the horizontal two-phase flow, for the inclined flow an exact mathematical theorem cannot be formulated. Nevertheless, it has been proven that 2D perturbations are the critical ones also for the case of inclined channel, since the transformation of a 3D stability problem to its 2D analog is associated with a stabilizing effect of reducing the system inclination, in addition to the reduction of the phases flow rates as in the case of horizontal flows.},

The photographic studies show that the transition from plug to slug flow occurs when the back of the bubble changes from staircase pattern to hydraulic jump with the increase of the Froude number and bubble length. The effect of pipe inclination on characteristics of bubble is significant: The bubble is inversely located in a downwardly inclined pipe when the Froude number is low, and the transition from plug flow to slug flow in an upward inclined pipe is more ready to occur compared with that in a downwardly inclined pipe.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. The method formally discretizes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid. Operations are limited to a finite computational domain through a lattice Green's function technique. This technique obtains solutions to inhomogeneous difference equations through the discrete convolution of source terms with the fundamental solutions of the discrete operators. The differential algebraic equations describing the temporal evolution of the discrete momentum equation and incompressibility constraint are numerically solved by combining an integrating factor technique for the viscous term and a half-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the convective term. A projection method that exploits the mimetic and commutativity properties of the discrete operators is used to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises in each stage of the time integration scheme. Linear complexity, fast computation rates, and parallel scalability are achieved using recently developed fast multipole methods for difference equations.

@article{Loret2008b,
abstract = {The previous chapters have displayed examples of partial differential equations in various fields of mathematical physics. Attention has been paid to the interpretation of these equations in the specific contexts they were presented. 1 In fact, we have delineated three types of field equations, namely hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The basic idea that the mathematical nature of these equations was fundamental to their physical significance has been creeping throughout. Still, the formats in which these three types were presented correspond to their canonical forms, that is, a form that one recognizes at first glance. Such is not the general case. For example, it is not obvious (to this author at least!) that the following second order equation, 2 ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − 4 ∂ 2 u ∂x∂t − 6 ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 + ∂u ∂x = 0 , is of hyperbolic type. In other words, it shares essential physical properties with the wave equation, ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 = 0 . Indeed, this is the aim of the present chapter to show that all equations of mathematical physics can be recast in these three fundamental types. By the same token, we introduce a new notion, that of a characteristic curve. A method to solve IBVPs based on characteristics will be exposed in the next chapter. The terminology used to coin the three types of PDEs borrows from geometry, as the criterion will be seen to rely on the nature of the roots of quadratic equations. We envisage in turn first of order equations, sets of first order equations, and second order equations. The use of a common terminology to class first and second order equations is challenged by the fact that a set of two first order equation may be transformed into a second},

There follows a comprehensive account of the mathematical theory for parallel shear flows. A number of applications of the linear theory are discussed, including the effects of stratification and unsteadiness. The emphasis throughout is on the ideas involved, the physical mechanisms, the methods used, and the results obtained. Wherever possible, the theory is related to both experimental and numerical results. A distinctive feature of the book is the large number of problems it contains. These problems (for which hints and references are given) not only provide exercises for students but also provide many additional results in a concise form.},

These fast, efficient, and accurate methods are an extension of the classical spectral methods of high-dimensional random spaces. Designed to simulate complex systems subject to random inputs, these methods are widely used in many areas of computer science and engineering. The book introduces polynomial approximation theory and probability theory, describes the basic theory of gPC methods through numerical examples and rigorous development, details the procedure for converting stochastic equations into deterministic ones, using both the Galerkin and collocation approaches, and discusses the distinct differences and challenges arising from high-dimensional problems. The last section is devoted to the application of gPC methods to critical areas such as inverse problems and data assimilation. Ideal for use by graduate students and researchers both in the classroom and for self-study, Numerical Methods for Stochastic Computations provides the required tools for in-depth research related to stochastic computations.The first graduate-level textbook to focus on the fundamentals of numerical methods for stochastic computations Ideal introduction for graduate courses or self-study Fast, efficient, and accurate numerical methods Polynomial approximation theory and probability theory included Basic gPC methods illustrated through examples},

The ultrasonic propagation in cancellous bone is modeled using the Biot theory modified by the Johnson et al. model for viscous exchange between fluid and structure. The sensitivity of the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame is studied showing their effect on the fast and slow wave forms. The inverse problem is solved numerically by the least squares method. Five parameters are inverted: the porosity, tortuosity, viscous characteristic length, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame. The minimization of the discrepancy between experiment and theory is made in the time domain. The inverse problem is shown to be well posed, and its solution to be unique. Experimental results for slow and fast waves transmitted through human cancellous bone samples are given and compared with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws. These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

@book{Manwell2014a,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This book presents applications of spectral methods to problems of uncertainty propagation and quantification in model-based computations, focusing on the computational and algorithmic features of these methods most useful in dealing with models based on partial differential equations, in particular models arising in simulations of fluid flows. Spectral stochastic methods are probabilistic in nature, and are consequently rooted in the rich mathematical foundations associated with probability and measure spaces. A brief discussion is provided of only those theoretical aspects needed to set the stage for subsequent applications. These are demonstrated through detailed treatments of elementary problems, as well as in more elaborate examples involving vortex-dominated flows and compressible flows at low Mach numbers. Some recent developments are also outlined in the book, including iterative techniques (such as stochastic multigrids and Newton schemes), intrusive and non-intrusive formalisms, spectral representations using mixed and discontinuous bases, multi-resolution approximations, and adaptive techniques. Readers are assumed to be familiar with elementary methods for the numerical solution of time-dependent, partial differential equations; prior experience with spectral approximation is helpful but not essential.},

@book{Hundsdorfer2003,
abstract = {This book describes numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) coupling advection, diffusion and reaction terms, encompassing methods for hyperbolic, parabolic and stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The emphasis lies on time-dependent transport-chemistry problems, describing e.g. the evolution of concentrations in environmental and biological applications. Along with the common topics of stability and convergence, much attention is paid on how to prevent spurious, negative concentrations and oscillations, both in space and time. Many of the theoretical aspects are illustrated by numerical experiments on models from biology, chemistry and physics. A unified approach is followed by emphasizing the method of lines or semi-discretization. In this regard this book differs substantially from more specialized textbooks which deal exclusively with either PDEs or ODEs. This book treats integration methods suitable for both classes of problems and thus is of interest to PDE researchers unfamiliar with advanced numerical ODE methods, as well as to ODE researchers unaware of the vast amount of interesting results on numerical PDEs.},

@book{Horn2013b,
abstract = {Preface to the Second Edition The basic structure of the first edition has been preserved in the second because it remains congruent with the goal of writing “a book that would be a useful modern treatment of a broad range of topics...[that] may be used as an undergraduate or graduate text and as a self-contained reference for a variety of audiences.” The quotation is from the Preface to the First Edition, whose declaration of goals for thework remains unchanged. What is different in the second edition? The core role of canonical forms has been expanded as a unifying element in understanding similarity (complex, real, and simultaneous), unitary equivalence, uni- tary similarity, congruence, *congruence, unitary congruence, triangular equivalence, and other equivalence relations. More attention is paid to cases of equality in the many inequalities considered in the book. Block matrices are a ubiquitous feature of the exposition in the new edition. Learning mathematics has never been a spectator sport, so the newedition continues to emphasize the value of exercises and problems for the active reader. Numerous 2-by-2 examples illustrate concepts throughout the book. Problem threads (some span several chapters) develop special topics as the foundation for them evolves in the text. For example, there are threads involving the adjugate matrix, the compound matrix, finite-dimensional quantum systems, the Loewner ellipsoid and the Loewner–John matrix, and normalizable matrices; see the index for page references for these threads. The first edition had about 690 problems; the second edition has more than 1,100. Many problems have hints; they may be found in an appendix that appears just before the index. A comprehensive index is essential for a book that is intended for sustained use as a reference after initial use as a text. The index to the first edition had about 1,200 entries; the current index has more than 3,500 entries. An unfamiliar term encountered in the text should be looked up in the index, where a pointer to a definition (in Chapter 0 or elsewhere) is likely to be found. New discoveries since 1985 have shaped the presentation of many topics and have stimulated inclusion of some new ones. A few examples of the latter are the Jordan canonical form of a rank-one perturbation, motivated by enduring student interest in the Google matrix; a generalization of real normal matrices (normal matrices A such that A ¯ A is real); computable block matrix criteria for simultaneous unitary similarity or simultaneous unitary congruence; G. Belitskii's discovery that a matrix commutes with a Weyr canonical form if and only if it is block upper triangular and has a special structure; the discovery by K. C. O'Meara and C. Vinsonhaler that, unlike the corresponding situation for the Jordan canonical form, a commuting family can be simultaneously upper triangularized by similarity in such a way that any one specified matrix in the family is in Weyr canonical form; and canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence. Queries from many readers have motivated changes in the way that some topics are presented. For example, discussion of Lidskii's eigenvalue majorization inequalities was moved from a section primarily devoted to singular value inequalities to the section where majorization is discussed. Fortunately, a splendid new proof of Lidskii's inequalities by C. K. Li and R. Mathias became available and was perfectly aligned with Chapter 4's new approach to eigenvalue inequalities for Hermitian matrices. A second example is a new proof of Birkhoff's theorem, which has a very different flavor from the proof in the first edition. Instructors accustomed to the order of topics in the first edition may be interested in a chapter-by-chapter summary of what is different in the new edition: 0. Chapter 0 has been expanded by about 75{\%} to include a more comprehensive summary of useful concepts and facts. It is intended to serve as an as-needed reference. Definitions of terms and notations used throughout the book can be found here, but it has no exercises or problems. Formal courses and reading for self-study typically begin with Chapter 1. 1. Chapter 1 contains new examples related to similarity and the characteristic poly- nomial, as well as an enhanced emphasis on the role of left eigenvectors in matrix analysis. 2. Chapter 2 contains a detailed presentation of real orthogonal similarity, an exposition of McCoy's theorem on simultaneous triangularization, and a rigor- ous treatment of continuity of eigenvalues that makes essential use of both the unitary and triangular aspects of Schur's unitary triangularization theorem. Sec- tion 2.4 (Consequences of Schur's triangularization theorem) is almost twice the length of the corresponding section in the first edition. There are two newsections, one devoted to the singular value decomposition and one devoted to the CS de- composition. Early introduction of the singular value decomposition permits this essential tool of matrix analysis to be used throughout the rest of the book. 3. Chapter 3 approaches the Jordan canonical form via the Weyr characteristic; it contains an exposition of the Weyr canonical form and its unitary variant that were not in the first edition. Section 3.2 (Consequences of the Jordan canonical form) discusses many new applications; it contains 60{\%} more material than the corresponding section in the first edition. 4. Chapter 4 now has a modern presentation of variational principles and eigen- value inequalities for Hermitian matrices via subspace intersections. It contains an expanded treatment of inverse problems associated with interlacing and other classical results. Its detailed treatment of unitary congruence includes Youla's theorem (a normal form for a square complex matrix A under unitary congruence that is associated with the eigenstructure of A ¯ A), as well as canonical forms for conjugate normal, congruence normal, and squared normal matrices. It also has an exposition of recently discovered canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence and new algorithms to construct a basis of a coneigenspace. 5. Chapter 5 contains an expanded discussion of norm duality, many new problems, and a treatment of semi-inner products that finds application in a discussion of finite-dimensional quantum systems in Chapter 7. 6. Chapter 6 has a newtreatment of the “disjoint discs” aspect of Gerˇ sgorin's theorem and a reorganized discussion of eigenvalue perturbations, including differentiabil- ity of a simple eigenvalue. 7. Chapter 7 has been reorganized now that the singular value decomposition is introduced in Chapter 2. There is a newtreatment of the polar decomposition, new factorizations related to the singular value decomposition, and special emphasis on rowand column inclusion. The von Neumann trace theorem (proved via Birkhoff's theorem) is now the foundation on which many applications of the singular value decomposition are built. The Loewner partial order and block matrices are treated in detail with new techniques, as are the classical determinant inequalities for positive definite matrices. 8. Chapter 8 uses facts about left eigenvectors developed in Chapter 1 to streamline its exposition of the Perron–Frobenius theory of positive and nonnegative matrices. D. Appendix D contains new explicit perturbation bounds for the zeroes of a poly- nomial and the eigenvalues of a matrix. F. Appendix F tabulates a modern list of canonical forms for a pair of Hermitian matrices, or a pair of matrices, one of which is symmetric and the other is skew symmetric. These canonical pairs are applications of the canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence presented in Chapter 4. Readers who are curious about the technology of book making may be interested to know that this book began as a set of L ATEX files created manually by a company in India from hard copy of the first edition. Those files were edited and revised using the ScientificWorkPlace R ?graphical user interface and typesetting system. The cover art for the second edition was the result of a lucky encounter on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles in spring 2003. The young man in the middle seat said he was an artist who paints abstract paintings that are sometimes mathematically inspired. In the course of friendly conversation, he revealed that his special area of mathematical enjoyment was linear algebra, and that he had studied Matrix Analysis. After mutual expressions of surprise at the chance nature of our meeting, and a pleasant discussion, we agreed that appropriate cover artwould enhance the visual appeal of the second edition; he said he would send something to consider. In due course a packet arrived from Seattle. It contained a letter and a stunning 4.5- by 5-inch color photograph, identified on the back as an image of a 72- by 66-inch oil on canvas, painted in 2002. The letter said that “the painting is entitled Surprised Again on the Diagonal and is inspired by the recurring prevalence of the diagonal in math whether it be in geometry, analysis, algebra, set theory or logic. I think that it would be an attractive addition to your wonderful book.” Thank you, Lun-Yi Tsai, for your wonderful cover art!

abstract = {Despite the long recognised effects of chromosomal structural abnormalities and completion of the Human Genome Project, much of the structural variation in the genome has gone unrecognised until recently. Deletions and duplications of DNA strands of between a few hundred bp and several million bp-collectively referred to as copy number variants-are now known to be widespread. Since 2007, rigorous and adequately powered genome-wide association studies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms have yielded replicated associations to several common diseases. Some copy number variants explain rare, previously uncharacterised disorders, and they are now expected to explain some of the genetic contribution to common diseases. We review efforts to map copy number variants and discuss present and future prospects for assessment of their relation to human health and disease.},

@article{Holthuijsen2007a,
abstract = {Waves in Oceanic and Coastal Waters describes the observation, analysis and prediction of wind-generated waves in the open ocean, in shelf seas, and in coastal regions with islands, channels, tidal flats and inlets, estuaries, fjords and lagoons. The book brings graduate students, researchers and engineers up-to-date with the science and technology involved, assuming only a basic understanding of physics, mathematics and statistics. Most of this richly illustrated book is devoted to the physical aspects of waves. After introducing observation techniques for waves, both at sea and from space, the book defines the parameters that characterize waves. Using basic statistical and physical concepts, the author discusses the prediction of waves in oceanic and coastal waters, first in terms of generalized observations, and then in terms of the more theoretical framework of the spectral energy balance. He gives the results of established theories and also the direction in which research is developing. The book ends with a description of SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore), the preferred computer model of the engineering community for predicting waves in coastal waters.},

The book emphasizes understanding CFD through physical principles and examples. The author follows a consistent philosophy of control volume formulation of the fundamental laws of fluid motion and energy transfer, and introduces a novel notion of ‘smoothing pressure correction' for solution of flow equations on collocated grids within the framework of the well-known SIMPLE algorithm. The subject matter is developed by considering pure conduction/diffusion, convective transport in 2-dimensional boundary layers and in fully elliptic flow situations and phase-change problems in succession. The book includes chapters on discretization of equations for transport of mass, momentum and energy on Cartesian, structured curvilinear and unstructured meshes, solution of discretised equations, numerical grid generation and convergence enhancement. Practising engineers will find this particularly useful for reference and for continuing education.},

Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians.A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is build. With only moderate prerequisites, it is an excellent textbook for graduate courses in mathematics, engineering, and computer science.

@book{Gustafsson1996b,
abstract = {Time dependent problems frequently pose challenges in areas of science and engineering dealing with numerical analysis, scientific computation, mathematical models, and most importantly--numerical experiments intended to analyze physical behavior and test design. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods addresses these various industrial considerations in a pragmatic and detailed manner, giving special attention to time dependent problems in its coverage of the derivation and analysis of numerical methods for computational approximations to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The book is written in two parts. Part I discusses problems with periodic solutions; Part II proceeds to discuss initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations and numerical methods for them. The problems with periodic solutions have been chosen because they allow the application of Fourier analysis without the complication that arises from the infinite domain for the corresponding Cauchy problem. Furthermore, the analysis of periodic problems provides necessary conditions when constructing methods for initial boundary value problems. Much of the material included in Part II appears for the first time in this book. The authors draw on their own interests and combined extensive experience in applied mathematics and computer science to bring about this practical and useful guide. They provide complete discussions of the pertinent theorems and back them up with examples and illustrations. For physical scientists, engineers, or anyone who uses numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena, this invaluable guide is destined to become a constant companion. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations. What Every Physical Scientist and Engineer Needs to Know About Time Dependent Problems . . . Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods covers the analysis of numerical methods for computing approximate solutions to partial differential equations for time dependent problems. This original book includes for the first time a concrete discussion of initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations. The authors have redone many of these results especially for this volume, including theorems, examples, and over one hundred illustrations. The book takes some less-than-obvious approaches to developing its material: * Treats differential equations and numerical methods with a parallel development, thus achieving a more useful analysis of numerical methods * Covers hyperbolic equations in particularly great detail * Emphasizes error bounds and estimates, as well as the sufficient results needed to justify the methods used for applications Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is written for physical scientists and engineers who use numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena. It is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations.},

@book{Canuto2006b,
abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {This book is intended for students who wish to get an introduction to the theory of partial differential equations. The author focuses on elliptic equations and systematically develops the relevant existence schemes, always with a view towards nonlinear problems. These are maximum principle methods (particularly important for numerical analysis schemes), parabolic equations, variational methods, and continuity methods. This book also develops the main methods for obtaining estimates for solutions of elliptic equations: Sobolev space theory, weak and strong solutions, Schauder estimates, and Moser iteration. Connections between elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations are explored, as well as the connection with Brownian motion and semigroups. This book can be utilized for a one-year course on partial differential equations. For the new edition the author has added a new chapter on reaction-diffusion equations and systems. There is also new material on Neumann boundary value problems, Poincar inequalities, expansions, as well as a new proof of the H lder regularity of solutions of the Poisson equation. J rgen Jost is Co-Director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Leipzig. He is the author of a number of Springer books, including Dynamical Systems (2005), Postmodern Analysis (3rd ed. 2005, also translated into Japanese), Compact Riemann Surfaces (3rd ed. 2006) and Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis (4th ed., 2005).

abstract = {This paper reviews the methods, benefits and challenges associated with the adoption and translation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling within cardiovascular medicine. CFD, a specialist area of mathematics and a branch of fluid mechanics, is used routinely in a diverse range of safety-critical engineering systems, which increasingly is being applied to the cardiovascular system. By facilitating rapid, economical, low-risk prototyping, CFD modelling has already revolutionised research and development of devices such as stents, valve prostheses, and ventricular assist devices. Combined with cardiovascular imaging, CFD simulation enables detailed characterisation of complex physiological pressure and flow fields and the computation of metrics which cannot be directly measured, for example, wall shear stress. CFD models are now being translated into clinical tools for physicians to use across the spectrum of coronary, valvular, congenital, myocardial and peripheral vascular diseases. CFD modelling is apposite for minimally-invasive patient assessment. Patient-specific (incorporating data unique to the individual) and multi-scale (combining models of different length- and time-scales) modelling enables individualised risk prediction and virtual treatment planning. This represents a significant departure from traditional dependence upon registry-based, population-averaged data. Model integration is progressively moving towards 'digital patient' or 'virtual physiological human' representations. When combined with population-scale numerical models, these models have the potential to reduce the cost, time and risk associated with clinical trials. The adoption of CFD modelling signals a new era in cardiovascular medicine. While potentially highly beneficial, a number of academic and commercial groups are addressing the associated methodological, regulatory, education- and service-related challenges.},

abstract = {An investigation of time marching computational fluid-structure interaction algorithms is presented. The analysis is applied to the piston problem. Attention is focussed on the time integration properties of the coupling algorithms. The staggered scheme is first investigated where fluid and structure are alternately integrated by separate solvers in a predictor-corrector fashion. This algorithm suffers from a time lag between the integration of the fluid and structure. The influence of the time lag is investigated by the comparison of different predictions for the structure. A novel monolithical algorithm is then introduced in order to annihilate the time lag. This algorithm integrates fluid, structure and interaction as a single system by an implicit algorithm. Linear acoustic as well as nonlinear Euler equations for gas dynamics are investigated. The numerical results of the staggered scheme reveal a non-physical deviation of the mean position of the piston at higher CFL numbers. The deviation of the mean position is not present in the calculation with the monolithical scheme. Stability analysis shows the unconditional stability of the monolithical scheme for the acoustic equations whereas the staggered scheme has a limited domain of stability. This domain can be enlarged by an improvement of the structural prediction. Analysis of the damping shows an energy production in the staggered scheme while the monolithical scheme has no energy production term. The analyses lead to the formulation of the Interaction Consistency Law which prescribes the relation for the time discretisation between fluid and structure solvers and their boundary conditions.},

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

A series of two experimental investigations were carried out on a 6m vertical pipe with a 0.067m internal diameter charged with an air–silicone oil mixture. For the first set of experiments, the riser was initially full of air, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and wire mesh sensor (WMS) transducers were employed. In the second one, the riser was initially full of (static) liquid, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, only ECT was used. A characterisation of the observed slug flow regimes was carried out. This includes the evaluation of the instantaneous distribution of the phases over the pipe cross-section, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of void fraction, time series of cross-sectional void fraction, Power Spectral Density (PSD), structure velocity of the Taylor bubble, lengths of the liquid slug and Taylor bubble and void fractions in the liquid slug and Taylor bubble. The simulation results were validated both qualitatively and quantitatively against experimental data. A reasonably good agreement was observed between the results of the experiment and CFD.},

abstract = {The increasing size of wind turbines, with rotors already spanning more than 150 m diameter and hub heights above 100 m, requires proper modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) from the surface to the free atmosphere. Furthermore, large wind farm arrays create their own boundary layer structure with unique physics. This poses significant challenges to traditional wind engineering models that rely on surface-layer theories and engineering wind farm models to simulate the flow in and around wind farms. However, adopting an ABL approach offers the opportunity to better integrate wind farm design tools and meteorological models. The challenge is how to build the bridge between atmospheric and wind engineering model communities and how to establish a comprehensive evaluation process that identifies relevant physical phenomena for wind energy applications with modeling and experimental requirements. A framework for model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification is established to guide this process by a systematic evaluation of the modeling system at increasing levels of complexity. In terms of atmospheric physics, ‘building the bridge' means developing models for the so-called ‘terra incognita,' a term used to designate the turbulent scales that transition from mesoscale to microscale. This range of scales within atmospheric research deals with the transition from parameterized to resolved turbulence and the improvement of surface boundary-layer parameterizations. The coupling of meteorological and wind engineering flow models and the definition of a formal model evaluation methodology, is a strong area of research for the next generation of wind conditions assessment and wind farm and wind turbine design tools. Some fundamental challenges are identified in order to guide future research in this area. WIREs Energy Environ 2017, 6:e214. doi: 10.1002/wene.214.

abstract = {A new method valid for highly dispersive and highly nonlinear water waves is presented. It combines a time-stepping of the exact surface boundary conditions with an approximate series expansion solution to the Laplace equation in the interior domain. The starting point is an exact solution to the Laplace equation given in terms of infinite series expansions from an arbitrary z-level. We replace the infinite series operators by finite series (Boussinesq-type) approximations involving up to fifth-derivative operators. The finite series are manipulated to incorporate Pad{\'{e}} approximants providing the highest possible accuracy for a given number of terms. As a result, linear and nonlinear wave characteristics become very accurate up to wavenumbers as high as kh = 40, while the vertical variation of the velocity field becomes applicable for kh up to 12.

@article{Zhang2014b,
abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical framework to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and wind energy production estimation. A meteorological tower based wind measurement campaign is considered exclusively, in which measure-correlate-predict is used to estimate the long-term wind resource.The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a powercurve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development.The approach in this paper provides a framework for an accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty and, therefore, better decisionmaking when assessing a potential wind energy site. It does not investigate the values of individual uncertainty sources. Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, methods for handling uncertainty sources in wind turbine power output and energy losses are presented. Third, a new method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty when using a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonly assumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should be scaled by a factor between 2 and 3 to yield the uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that this assumption is an oversimplification and also presents a closed form solution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model capable of simulating offshore wind turbines exposed to extreme loading conditions. External condition-based extreme responses are reproduced by coupling a fully nonlinear wave kinematic solver with a hydro-aero-elastic simulator. The transient nonlinear free surface problem of water waves is formulated assuming the potential theory and a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to discretize Laplace's equation. For temporal evolution a second-order Taylor series expansion is implemented. The code is successfully adopted to simulate overturning plunging breakers, which give rise to dangerous impact loads when they break against wind turbine substructures. Emphasis is also placed on the development of a global simulation framework that aims at embedding the wave simulator into a more general stochastic environment. Indeed, first a linear irregular sea is generated by a spectral approach, then only on critical sub-domains, where wave impacts are expected, the fully nonlinear solver is invoked for a more refined simulation. This permits to systematically account for dangerous effects on the structural response (which would be missed by adopting linear or weakly nonlinear wave theories alone) without penalizing the computational effort. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, there is a continuous need to find a 'good' wake model to properly plan wind power plant-level control strategies, predict the performance and understand the fatigue loads of turbines. In this paper, six widely used approaches of wake modelling (Jensen, Larsen, Dynamic Wake Meandering, Fuga and, Ellipsys3D LES and RANS together with their interpretations) that were developed at Technical University of Denmark, are described and the model subcomponents are analysed. The models are evaluated using data from the Sexbierum (onshore) and the Lillgrund (offshore) wind farms to understand how to best utilize them. The paper provides a comprehensive conceptual background to wake modelling combined with the overview of the state-of-the-art models including their implementations on operating wind farms.},

The ROM is evaluated by means of dynamic mode decomposition performed on high fidelity LES numerical simulations of wind turbines operating under different operational regimes. The ROM enables to capture the main physical processes underpinning the downstream evolution and dynamics of wind turbine wakes. The ROM is then embedded within a Kalman filter in order to produce a time-marching algorithm for prediction of wind turbine wake flows. This data-driven algorithm enables data assimilation of new measurements simultaneously to the wake prediction, which leads to an improved accuracy and a dynamic update of the ROM in presence of emerging coherent wake dynamics observed from new available data. Thanks to its low computational cost, this numerical tool is particularly suitable for real-time applications, control and optimization of large wind farms.},

abstract = {In the wind energy industry there is a growing need for real-time predictions of wind turbine wake flows in order to optimize power plant control and inhibit detrimental wake interactions. To this aim, a data-driven RANS approach is proposed in order to achieve very low computational costs and adequate accuracy through the data assimilation procedure. The RANS simulations are implemented with a classical Boussinesq hypothesis and a mixing length turbulence closure model, which is calibrated through the available data. High-fidelity LES simulations of a utility-scale wind turbine operating with different tip speed ratios are used as database. It is shown that the mixing length model for the RANS simulations can be calibrated accurately through the Reynolds stress of the axial and radial velocity components, and the gradient of the axial velocity in the radial direction. It is found that the mixing length is roughly invariant in the very near wake, then it increases linearly with the downstream distance in the diffusive region. The variation rate of the mixing length in the downstream direction is proposed as a criterion to detect the transition between near wake and transition region of a wind turbine wake. Finally, RANS simulations were performed with the calibrated mixing length model, and a good agreement with the LES simulations is observed.},

abstract = {Wind tunnel measurements were performed for the wake produced by a three-bladed wind turbine immersed in uniform flow. These tests show the presence of a vorticity structure in the near-wake region mainly oriented along the streamwise direction, which is denoted as the hub vortex. The hub vortex is characterized by oscillations with frequencies lower than that connected to the rotational velocity of the rotor, which previous works have ascribed to wake meandering. This phenomenon consists of transversal oscillations of the wind turbine wake, which might be excited by the vortex shedding from the rotor disc acting as a bluff body. In this work, temporal and spatial linear stability analyses of a wind turbine wake are performed on a base flow obtained with time-averaged wind tunnel velocity measurements. This study shows that the low-frequency spectral component detected experimentally matches the most amplified frequency of the counter-winding single-helix mode downstream of the wind turbine. Then, simultaneous hot-wire measurements confirm the presence of a helicoidal unstable mode of the hub vortex with a streamwise wavenumber roughly equal to that predicted from the linear stability analysis.},

In order to provide reliable wind power forecasts for periods beyond a couple of hours, forecasts of the wind speed are fundamental. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for wind speed that is based on stochastic differential equations. We show that stochastic differential equations allow us to capture the time dependence structure of wind speed prediction errors naturally (from 1 to 24 h ahead) and, most importantly, to derive point and quantile forecasts, predictive distributions, and time-path trajectories (also referred to as scenarios or ensemble forecasts), all using one single stochastic differential equation model that is characterized by a few parameters.},

abstract = {Clustering wind turbines as a wind farm to share the infrastructure is an effective strategy to reduce the cost of energy. However, this results in aerodynamic wake interaction among wind turbines. Yawing the upstream wind turbines can mitigate the losses in wind farm power output. Yaw-misalignment also affects the loads, as partial wake overlap can increase fatigue of downstream turbines. This paper studies multi-objective optimization of wind farm wake using yaw-misalignment to increase power production and reduce loads due to partial wake overlap. This is achieved using a computational framework consisting of an aerodynamic model for wind farm wake, a blade-element-momentum model to compute the power and the loads, and a gradient-based optimizer. The results show that yaw-misalignment is capable of increasing the power production of the wind farm, while reducing the loading due to partial wake overlap. A multi-objective optimization is able to further decrease the loads at the expense of a small amount of power production.},

@article{Fluck2016c,
abstract = {For many unsteady processes (e.g. turbulent wind, electricity demand, traffic, financial markets, space physics, etc.) data is only available at discrete points, be it due to data storage or data gathering limitations. However, derived forms of that data are often used in further studies where the discretization may be different from the discretization of the original data. This paper addresses the question of how to obtain values between discrete data points, for example, when sampling turbulent wind. Linear interpolation is often the standard answer. Yet, it is shown that this is a poor choice for unsteady processes where the sample step size is significantly larger than the fluctuation scale. An alternative employing probability density functions of data increments is suggested. While this new method does not require much more effort than linear interpolation, it yields significantly more accurate results. Unsteady wind is used to exemplify this: turbulent wind speeds on a (rotating) wind turbine blade are synthesized from a coarse data grid via the introduced method of velocity increments. Thus the superiority of the presented approach over linear interpolation is demonstrated - with important implications for blade load and power output computations.},

abstract = {Given a wind-farm with known dimensions and number of wind-turbines, we try to find the optimum positioning of wind-turbines that maximises wind-farm energy production. In practise, given that optimisation has to be performed for many wind directions and taking into account the yearly wind distribution, such an optimisation is computationally only feasible using fast engineering wake models such as, e.g., the Jensen model. These models are known to have accuracy issues, in particular since their representation of wake interaction is very simple. In the present work, we propose an optimisation approach that is based on a hybrid combination of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and the Jensen model, in which optimisation is mainly performed using the Jensen model, and LES is used at a few points only during optimisation for online tuning of the wake-expansion coefficient in the Jensen model, and for validation of the results. An optimisation case study is considered, in which the placement of 30 turbines in a 4 by 3 km rectangular domain is optimised in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Both optimisation for single wind direction, and multiple wind directions are discussed.},

abstract = {A new methodology, the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO), that addresses critical aspects of optimal wind farm planning is presented in this paper. This methodology simultaneously determines the optimum farm layout and the appropriate selection of turbines (in terms of their rotor diameters) that maximizes the net power generation. The farm layout model obviates traditional restrictions imposed on the location of turbines. A standard analytical wake model has been used to account for the velocity deficits in the wakes created by individual turbines. The wind farm power generation model is validated against data from a wind tunnel experiment on a scaled down wind farm. Reasonable agreement between the model and experimental results is obtained. The complex nonlinear optimization problem presented by the wind farm model is effectively solved using constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It is found that an optimal combination of wind turbines with differing rotor diameters can appreciably improve the farm efficiency. A preliminary wind farm cost analysis is performed to express the cost in terms of the turbine rotor diameters and the number of turbines in the farm. Subsequent exploration of the influences of (i) the number of turbines, and (ii) the farm land size, on the cost per Kilowatt of power produced, yields important observations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering application. For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the models are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many fields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

The framework accounts for noise in the independent variables, and we present alternative for-mulations for accounting for discrepancies between model and data. To generate probability densities for flow characteristics, posterior densities for sub-grid scale model parameters are propagated forward through LES of channel flow and compared with DNS data. Synthesis of the calibration and prediction results demonstrates that model parameters have an explicit filter width dependence and are highly correlated. Dis-crepancies between DNS and calibrated LES results point to additional model form inadequacies that need to be accounted for.},

abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real-time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors.},

@article{Sudret2007b,
abstract = {Probabilistic engineering mechanics aims at taking into account uncertainties on input parameters of mechanical models and studying their impact onto the model response. This field lies at the interface between mechanics, statistics and probability theory and encompasses various applications such as struc- tural reliability, stochastic finite element analysis and random vibrations. This thesis introduces a global framework for dealing with uncertainties in mechanics and presents original results in this context. The proposed global scheme for dealing with uncertainties relies upon three steps, namely the definition of the mathematical model of the physical system, the probabilistic characterization of the uncertainty on the input parameters and the propagation of the uncertainty through the model. Various computational schemes may be applied in practice according to the type of analysis of interest, namely statistical moment-, distribution, reliability and sensitivity analysis. In order to make the reading easier, elementary notions of probability theory and statistics are recalled in Chapter 2. Methods for building the probabilistic model of the input parameters from the available data are reviewed, including expert judgment, principle of maximum entropy, classical and Bayesian inference. The modelling of spatially variable data using random fields is also adressed. A short state-of-the-art on classical uncertainty propagation methods is given in Chapter 3. Second moment methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, perturbation and quadrature methods are reviewed, as well as structural reliability methods such as FORM/SORM and importance sampling. Various mea- sures of sensitivity such as importance factors and Sobol' indices used for ranking the input parameters according to their importance are finally introduced. Stochastic spectral methods are addressed in Chapter 4. They are based on the representation of the random model response in terms of polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). The principle of the so-called Galerkin intrusive solution scheme, which is well adapted to solve elliptic stochastic problems is first introduced. Then the non intrusive projection and regression schemes are detailed, which allow the analyst to compute the coefficients of the response PCE using a series of deterministic calculations based on a selected set of input parameters. The post-processing of the PCE coefficients in order to compute the response distribution and the statistical moments or to solve reliability and sensitivity problems is shown. An illustrative example dealing with a linear truss structure allows one to compare the relative efficiency of the various approaches. The uncertainty propagation methods rely upon a probabilistic model of the input parameters, which may be difficult to build up in practice. In Chapter 5, problems in which information related to the system response is available are considered. When dealing with some particular real system, for which monitoring data is available, one may resort to Bayesian updating techniques in order to improve the model predictions: Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC) is proposed in this context together with a Bayesian inverse FORM approach inspired by structural reliability methods. When the aleatoric uncertainty of some non measurable input parameters is of interest (whose uncertainty is caught through the very scattering of the measured model response), a stochastic inverse problem shall be solved. A method based on the polynomial chaos expansion of the input parameters is proposed in this context. ix x Chapter 6 adresses so-called time-variant reliability problems, in which time may appear in the modelling of loads (e.g. using random processes) or degrading materials. The outcrossing approach is introduced in order to compute bounds to the cumulative probability of failure by either an asymptotic approach or the so-called PHI2 method, which was partly developed by the author. Space-variant reliability problems are finally considered. The extent of damage, which is the volume of the subsystem in which some pointwise failure criterion is attained, is defined and studied. The durability of a RC beam submitted to concrete carbonation and rebars corrosion is finally addressed for the sake of illustration. Most of the results gathered in this thesis have been obtained starting from real industrial problems that were of interest to eDF. Thus Chapter 7 presents three direct applications of this research, namely a probabilistic framework for thermal fatigue design of pipes in nuclear power plants, a study of the durability of cooling towers and the non linear fracture mechanics of cracked pipes.},

abstract = {Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes$\backslash$n(RANS)$\backslash$nmodels are widely used in industry to predict fluid flows, despite their acknowledged deficiencies. Not only do RANS$\backslash$nmodels often produce inaccurate flow predictions, but there are very limited diagnostics available to assess RANS accuracy for a given flow configuration. If experimental or higher fidelity simulation results are not available for RANS validation, there is no reliable method to evaluate RANS accuracy. This paper explores the potential of utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify regions of high RANS uncertainty. Three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated: support vector machines, Adaboost decision trees, and random forests. The algorithms were trained on a database of canonical flow configurations for which validated direct numerical simulation or large eddy simulation results were available, and were used to classify RANS results on a point-by-point basis as having either high or low uncertainty, based on the breakdown of specific RANS$\backslash$nmodeling assumptions. Classifiers were developed for three different basic RANS$\backslash$neddy$\backslash$nviscosity$\backslash$nmodel assumptions: the isotropy of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity, the linearity of the Boussinesq hypothesis, and the non-negativity of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity. It is shown that these classifiers are able to generalize to flows substantially different from those on which they were trained. Feature selection techniques, model evaluation, and extrapolation detection are discussed in the context of turbulence modeling applications.},

Our sensitivity methodology relies on the non-intrusive approach of the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method; the gPC is a spectral non-statistical numerical method well-suited to representing random processes not restricted to Gaussian fields. The analysis is carried out at Re$\lambda$=100 and for different grid resolutions and Cs distributions. Numerical predictions are also compared to direct numerical simulation evidence. We have shown that the different turbulent scales of the LES solution respond differently to the variability in Cs. In particular, the study of the relative turbulent kinetic energy distributions for different Cs distributions indicates that small scales are mainly affected by changes in the subgrid-model parametric uncertainty.},

@article{Mackay1998b,
abstract = {Feedforward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons are popular tools for nonlinear regression and classification problems. From a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be viewed as defining a prior probability distribution over non-linear functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but otherwise standard networks, Neal (1996) has shown that the prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network model determine the characteristic length scales of the Gaussian process. Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. In this chapter I will review work on this idea by Williams and Rasmussen (1996), Neal (1997), Barber and Williams (1997) and Gibbs and MacKay (1997), and will assess whether, for supervised regression and classification tasks, the feedforward network has been superceded.},

abstract = {We propose an adaptive sparse grid stochastic collocation approach based upon Leja interpolation sequences for approximation of parameterized functions with high-dimensional parameters. Leja sequences are arbitrarily granular (any number of nodes may be added to a current sequence, producing a new sequence) and thus are a good choice for the univariate composite rule used to construct adaptive sparse grids in high dimensions. When undertaking stochastic collocation one is often interested in constructing weighted approximation where the weights are determined by the probability densities of the random variables. This paper establishes that a certain weighted formulation of one-dimensional Leja sequences produces a sequence of nodes whose empirical distribution converges to the corresponding limiting distribution of the Gauss quadrature nodes associated with the weight function. This property is true even for unbounded domains. We apply the Leja-sparse grid approach to several high-dimensional and problems and demonstrate that Leja sequences are often superior to more standard sparse grid constructions (e.g. Clenshaw-Curtis), at least for interpolatory metrics.},

abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems of mathematical physics including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

In spite of this success, wind energy has still not made a definitive breakthrough. The main reason for this is that it has to compete with conventionally generated electricity, which often is cheaper, or at least appears to be if environmental costs are not taken into account. For wind to make a really substantial contribution to world energy supply, it is therefore imperative that the cost ofwind energy is brought down even further,which means thatwind turbines must be designed to be exactly as strong as necessary, but no stronger.

abstract = {In this study, an efficient Bayesian method based on the adaptive sparse grid interpolation is used to solve the contaminant source identification problem. The unknown parameters that characterize the contaminant source are treated as random variables and identified by the Bayesian approach. To alleviate the computational burden in the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, a surrogate system with the polynomial form is constructed by the stochastic collocation method (SCM), which employs the interpolation based on the sparse grids rather than those based on the full tensor product. Furthermore, an adaptive scheme is used to take the different importance of the parameters into account. Therefore, the computational burden is significantly reduced. Once the surrogate system is determined, the likelihood can be evaluated by sampling the surrogate system directly, with very little computational cost. To improve the accuracy, we propose an auxiliary SCM based approach, where the surrogate system serves as a guidance for the fast adaption of the proposal distribution in the MCMC method. Numerical cases show that, under certain conditions, this method can greatly reduce the computational burden in the MCMC sampling and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant source. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Lackner2007b,
abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical approach to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and wind energy production estimation. The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a power curve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development. Many current methods for assessing uncertainty either oversimplify the process or make faulty assumptions, leading to erroneous estimates of uncertainty. The approach in this paper yields a more accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty, and therefore better decision making when assessing a potential wind energy site. Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, uncertainty in wind turbine power output and energy production is characterized. Third, a method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty when using a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonly assumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should be scaled by a factor between two and three to yield the uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that this assumption is an oversimplification, and also presents a closed form solution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian inference. Although typically less accurate than, for example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because they do not require the specification of a likelihood function. For this reason considerable amounts of data can be analysed and more complex models can be used providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model to the data. Since its first applications in the late 1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The framework was originally developed to solve problems in population genetics. However, as its efficiency was recognized its popularity increased and, consequently, it started to be used in fields as diverse as phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is still being greatly studied and alterations to it are being proposed, the statistical approach has already reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the number of related computer packages that are being developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the expansion of the use of this method can only increase. In this paper we are going to depict the context that led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to describe its current usage in such field and present its most recent developments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present an efficient numerical strategy for the Bayesian solution of inverse problems. Stochastic collocation methods, based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solution over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a surrogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal computational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior. The numerical strategy and the predicted convergence rates are then demonstrated on nonlinear inverse problems of varying smoothness and dimension. {\textcopyright} 2009 Global-Science Press.},

abstract = {In this study, large-eddy simulations (LESs) were performed to investigate the effects of changing wind direction on the turbine wakes and associated power losses in the Horns Rev offshore wind farm. In the LES framework, the turbulent subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized using a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic model, and the turbine-induced forces are computed using a dynamic actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R). This dynamic ADM-R couples blade-element theory with a turbine-specific relation between the blade angular velocity and the shaft torque to compute simultaneously turbine angular velocity and power output. A total of 67 simulations were performed for a wide range of wind direction angles. Results from the simulations show a strong impact of wind direction on the spatial distribution of turbine-wake characteristics, such as velocity deficit and turbulence intensity. This can be explained by the fact that changing the wind angle can be viewed as changing the wind farm layout relative to the incoming wind, while keeping the same wind turbine density. Of particular importance is the effect of wind direction on the distance available for the wakes to recover and expand before encountering other downwind turbines (in full-wake or partial-wake interactions), which affects the power losses from those turbines. As a result, even small changes in wind direction angle can have strong impacts on the total wind farm power output. For example, a change in wind direction of just 10° from the worst-case full-wake condition is found to increase the total power output by as much as 43{\%}. This has important implications for the design of wind farms and the management of the temporal variability of their power output.},

Our method also allows us to examine the structural error in the CLM under two error models.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In the field of uncertainty quantification, uncertainty in the governing equations may assume two forms: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty can be characterised by known probability distributions whilst epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge of probabilistic information. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the numerical treatment of aleatory uncertainty, little attention has been given to the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a numerical framework for quantification of epistemic uncertainty. The proposed methodology does not require any probabilistic information on uncertain input parameters. The method only necessitates an estimate of the range of the uncertain variables that encapsulates the true range of the input variables with overwhelming probability. To quantify the epistemic uncertainty, we solve an encapsulation problem, which is a solution to the original governing equations defined on the estimated range of the input variables. We discuss solution strategies for solving the encapsulation problem and the sufficient conditions under which the numerical solution can serve as a good estimator for capturing the effects of the epistemic uncertainty. In the case where probability distributions of the epistemic variables become known a posteriori, we can use the information to post-process the solution and evaluate solution statistics. Convergence results are also established for such cases, along with strategies for dealing with mixed aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure and properties of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This article presents an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for integration problems, including convergence theory, sampling methods and variance reduction techniques. Accelerated convergence for Monte Carlo quadrature is attained using quasi-random (also called low-discrepancy) sequences, which are a deterministic alternative to random or pseudo-random sequences. The points in a quasi-random sequence are correlated to provide greater uniformity. The resulting quadrature method, called quasi-Monte Carlo, has a convergence rate of approximately O((logN)kN−1). For quasi-Monte Carlo, both theoretical error estimates and practical limitations are presented. Although the emphasis in this article is on integration, Monte Carlo simulation of rarefied gas dynamics is also discussed. In the limit of small mean free path (that is, the fluid dynamic limit), Monte Carlo loses its effectiveness because the collisional distance is much less than the fluid dynamic length scale. Computational examples are presented throughout the text to illustrate the theory. A number of open problems are described.},

We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Additionally, the use of alternative approaches such as cultural algorithms, small population sizes and hybrids that use a few solutions (generated with optimizers that sacrifice diversity for the sake of a faster convergence) to reconstruct the Pareto front with powerful local search engines are also briefly discussed.

@article{Raissi2017,
abstract = {For more than two centuries, solutions of differential equations have been obtained either analytically or numerically based on typically well-behaved forcing and boundary conditions for well-posed problems. We are changing this paradigm in a fundamental way by establishing an interface between probabilistic machine learning and differential equations. We develop data-driven algorithms for general linear equations using Gaussian process priors tailored to the corresponding integro-differential operators. The only observables are scarce noisy multi-fidelity data for the forcing and solution that are not required to reside on the domain boundary. The resulting predictive posterior distributions quantify uncertainty and naturally lead to adaptive solution refinement via active learning. This general framework circumvents the tyranny of numerical discretization as well as the consistency and stability issues of time-integration, and is scalable to high-dimensions.},

Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2 advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following Elliott and O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of {\$}\backslashlog((z+1)/(z-1)){\$} in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad$\backslash$'e approximation at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$}. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$} is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near {\$}[-1,1]{\$}.},

abstract = {We present a novel numerical procedure for the prediction of nonlinear hydrodynamic loads exerted on offshore wind turbines exposed to severe weather conditions. The main feature of the proposed procedure is the computational efficiency, which makes the numerical package suitable for design purposes when a large number of simulations are typically necessary. The small computational effort is due to (i) the use of a domain-decomposition strategy, that, according to the local wave steepness, requires the numerical solution of the nonlinear governing equations only on a limited number of reduced regions (sub-domains) of the whole space-time domain, (ii) the choice of the particular numerical method for the spatial discretization of the governing equation for the water-wave problem. Within the potential flow assumption, the Laplace equation is solved by means of a higher-order boundary-element method (HOBEM). For the time evolution of the unsteady free-surface equations the 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is adopted. The compound solver is successfully applied to simulate nonlinear waves up to overturning plunging breakers, that may cause severe impact loads on the wind turbine substructure.Emphasis is finally given to wind turbine exposed to realistic environmental conditions, where the proposed tool is shown to be capable of capturing important nonlinear effects not detected by the linear models routinely adopted in the design practice. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

By solving the adjoint equations of the flow model, the gradients needed for optimization are found at a cost that is independent of the number of control variables, thereby permitting optimization of large wind plants with many turbine locations. Moreover, compared to the common approach of superimposing prescribed wake deficits onto linearized flow models, the computational efficiency of the adjoint approach allows the use of higher-fidelity RANS flow models which can capture nonlinear turbulent flow physics within a wind plant.

abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {For many unsteady processes (e.g. turbulent wind, electricity demand, traffic, financial markets, space physics, etc.) data is only available at discrete points, be it due to data storage or data gathering limitations. However, derived forms of that data are often used in further studies where the discretization may be different from the discretization of the original data. This paper addresses the question of how to obtain values between discrete data points, for example, when sampling turbulent wind. Linear interpolation is often the standard answer. Yet, it is shown that this is a poor choice for unsteady processes where the sample step size is significantly larger than the fluctuation scale. An alternative employing probability density functions of data increments is suggested. While this new method does not require much more effort than linear interpolation, it yields significantly more accurate results. Unsteady wind is used to exemplify this: turbulent wind speeds on a (rotating) wind turbine blade are synthesized from a coarse data grid via the introduced method of velocity increments. Thus the superiority of the presented approach over linear interpolation is demonstrated - with important implications for blade load and power output computations.},

However, offshore wind turbines are typically placed in relatively shallow water depths of 5-25 m where linear wave theory has limited accuracy and where ideally waves generated with the Navier-Stokes approach should be used. This article examines the differences in fatigue for some representative offshore wind turbines that are found if first-order, second-order and fully non-linear waves are used. The offshore wind turbines near Blyth are located in an area where non-linear wave effects are common. Measurements of these waves from the OWTES project are used to compare the different wave models with the real world in spectral form. Some attention is paid to whether the shape of a higher-order wave height spectrum (modified JONSWAP) corresponds to reality for other places in the North Sea, and which values for the drag and inertia coefficients should be used.

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model capable of simulating offshore wind turbines exposed to extreme loading conditions. External condition-based extreme responses are reproduced by coupling a fully nonlinear wave kinematic solver with a hydro-aero-elastic simulator. The transient nonlinear free surface problem of water waves is formulated assuming the potential theory and a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to discretize Laplace's equation. For temporal evolution a second-order Taylor series expansion is implemented. The code is successfully adopted to simulate overturning plunging breakers, which give rise to dangerous impact loads when they break against wind turbine substructures. Emphasis is also placed on the development of a global simulation framework that aims at embedding the wave simulator into a more general stochastic environment. Indeed, first a linear irregular sea is generated by a spectral approach, then only on critical sub-domains, where wave impacts are expected, the fully nonlinear solver is invoked for a more refined simulation. This permits to systematically account for dangerous effects on the structural response (which would be missed by adopting linear or weakly nonlinear wave theories alone) without penalizing the computational effort. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new method valid for highly dispersive and highly nonlinear water waves is presented. It combines a time-stepping of the exact surface boundary conditions with an approximate series expansion solution to the Laplace equation in the interior domain. The starting point is an exact solution to the Laplace equation given in terms of infinite series expansions from an arbitrary z-level. We replace the infinite series operators by finite series (Boussinesq-type) approximations involving up to fifth-derivative operators. The finite series are manipulated to incorporate Pad{\'{e}} approximants providing the highest possible accuracy for a given number of terms. As a result, linear and nonlinear wave characteristics become very accurate up to wavenumbers as high as kh = 40, while the vertical variation of the velocity field becomes applicable for kh up to 12. These results represent a major improvement over existing Boussinesq-type formulations in the literature. A numerical model is developed in a single horizontal dimension and it is used to study phenomena such as solitary waves and their impact on vertical walls, modulational instability in deep water involving recurrence or frequency downshift, and shoaling of regular waves up to breaking in shallow water.},

abstract = {A Kalman filter based sequential estimator is presented in the present work. The estimator is integrated in the structure of segregated solvers for the analysis of incompressible flows. This technique provides an augmented flow state integrating available observation in the CFD model, naturally preserving a zero-divergence condition for the velocity field. Because of the prohibitive costs associated with a complete Kalman Filter application, two model reduction strategies have been proposed and assessed. These strategies dramatically reduce the increase in computational costs of the model, which can be quantified in an increase of {\$}10\backslash{\%} - 15\backslash{\%}{\$} with respect to the classical numerical simulation. In addition, an extended analysis of the behavior of the numerical model covariance {\$}Q{\$} has been performed. The results have shown that optimized values are strongly linked to the truncation error of the discretization procedure. The estimator has been applied to the analysis of a number of test cases exhibiting increasing complexity, including turbulent flow configurations. The results show that the augmented flow successfully improves the prediction of the physical quantities investigated, even when the observation is provided in a limited region of the physical domain. In addition, the present work indicates that these Data Assimilation techniques, which are at an embryonic stage of development in CFD, can be pushed even further using the augmented prediction as a powerful tool for the optimization of the free parameters in the numerical simulation.},

For all liquid viscosities, a maximum velocity value was observed between 30° and 50° inclinations from horizontal. A unified dimensionless closure relationship for drift velocity is proposed.

The current weather forecasting paradigm is deterministic, based on numerical models.

abstract = {A Markov model for the performance of wind turbines is developed that accounts for component reliability and the effect of wind speed and turbine capacity on component reliability. The model is calibrated to the observed performance of offshore turbines in the north of Europe, and uses wind records obtained from the coast of the state of Maine in the northeast United States in simulation. Simulation results indicate availability of 0.91, with mean residence time in the operating state that is nearly exponential and has a mean of 42 days. Using a power curve typical for a 2.5 MW turbine, the capacity factor is found to be beta distributed and highly non-Gaussian. Noticeable seasonal variation in turbine and farm performance metrics are observed and result from seasonal fluctuations in the characteristics of the wind record. The input parameters to the Markov model, as defined in this paper, are limited to those for which field data are available for calibra- tion. Nevertheless, the framework of the model is readily adaptable to include, for exam- ple: site specific conditions; turbine details; wake induced loading effects; component redundancies; and dependencies. An on-off model is introduced as an approximation to the stochastic process describing the operating state of a wind turbine, and from this on- off process an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (O–U) process is developed as a model for the avail- ability of a wind farm. The O–U model agrees well with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the Markov model and is accepted as a valid approximation. Using the O–U model in design and management of large wind farms will be advantageous because it can provide statistics of wind farm performance without resort to intensive large scale MC simulation.},

In order to provide reliable wind power forecasts for periods beyond a couple of hours, forecasts of the wind speed are fundamental. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for wind speed that is based on stochastic differential equations. We show that stochastic differential equations allow us to capture the time dependence structure of wind speed prediction errors naturally (from 1 to 24 h ahead) and, most importantly, to derive point and quantile forecasts, predictive distributions, and time-path trajectories (also referred to as scenarios or ensemble forecasts), all using one single stochastic differential equation model that is characterized by a few parameters.},

abstract = {This paper is my personal recollection tracing the most signal events in the history of the initiation, development, and propagation phases of multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which started in 1970. There are overlaps in the transitions from one phase to another. I define the initiation phase as beginning with Charles W. (Chuck) Solbrig in 1970 and ending roughly in 1975-1977 with the dissolution of the original SLOOP (seriated loop) code group. The development phase extends from 1977 to roughly 1992-1993. The propaga- tion phase extends from 1993 to the present. While not claiming to be definitive, this review has as its primary objective the documentation of some of its most significant milestones and events. The history of multiphase CFD is intimately and inextricably connected with a significant portion of the career of Professor Dimitri Gidaspow who is honored in this special issue of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research by colleagues, former students, and experts in the field of mul- tiphase flow, especially fluidization and solids transport. A very brief account from a different perspective was presented at “A Festschrift to Honor Professor Dimitri Gidaspow on His 65th Birthday” which I organized at the 33rd National Heat Transfer Conference, August 15-17, 1999, at the Hyatt Regency in Albuquerque, NM.1 Emphasis herein is on the initiation phase since it has not been formally documented previously, to my knowledge.},

abstract = {In this paper, non-deterministic CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations have been performed to investigate the uncertain effects of stochastic boundary conditions on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines. A NIPRC (non-intrusive probabilistic collocation) method is employed, which is coupled with a commercial flow solver. A 2D (two-dimensional) airfoil case is used to validate the non-deterministic simulation, where the angle of attack is considered as an uncertain parameter in a Gaussian distribution. The simulation results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation results. Based on the validation, non-deterministic CFD simulations were performed on a 3D (three-dimensional) wind turbine blades case, where the wind speed is considered as an uncertain parameter. The discussions mainly focus on the total performance variations and the uncertainty propagation in the fluid field. The simulation results show that the input uncertainty of the inlet velocity results in a high variation zone in the pressure distribution near the blade root, and which decreases from the root to the tip. With the wind speed increases, flow separation is observed. The separation vortex regions correspond to the maximum variation area, and the maximum variation extends to the trailing edge even to the whole suction side.},

This paper reviews computational as well as experimental methods used to measure the aerodynamic performance of HAWT blades. Among the numerical methods, we examine classical blade element momentum (BEM) theory and the modified BEM as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the BEM-CFD mixed approach. We also discuss the current computational methods for investigating turbine wake flows. Among the experimental methods, we examine field testing and wind tunnel experiment including aerodynamic torque measurement and blockage effects.

abstract = {Linear stability analysis is being widely used in exploring gas-liquid stratified/non-stratified transitions. As the present study relates to liquid-liquid two-phase systems, the stability characteristics of stratified layers are considered. In parallel, the conditions necessary for real characteristics are also explored. The relations between stability conditions and those for well-posedness are discussed in view of the implications for flow pattern transitions. The convergence of the stability conditions to various extremes is discussed. The integrated considerations of stability and well-posedness shed light on the physical sequences in flow pattern transitions, which so far have been studied by stability analysis alone. As liquid-liquid systems are involved, wide ranges of density and viscosity ratios are studied for various operational conditions.},

abstract = {Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper implicit Runge-Kutta methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving Runge-Kutta methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive Runge-Kutta methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau IIA/B method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau IIA/B method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convectiondominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau IIA/B method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Porte-Agel2013a,
abstract = {In this study, large-eddy simulations (LESs) were performed to investigate the effects of changing wind direction on the turbine wakes and associated power losses in the Horns Rev offshore wind farm. In the LES framework, the turbulent subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized using a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic model, and the turbine-induced forces are computed using a dynamic actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R). This dynamic ADM-R couples blade-element theory with a turbine-specific relation between the blade angular velocity and the shaft torque to compute simultaneously turbine angular velocity and power output. A total of 67 simulations were performed for a wide range of wind direction angles. Results from the simulations show a strong impact of wind direction on the spatial distribution of turbine-wake characteristics, such as velocity deficit and turbulence intensity. This can be explained by the fact that changing the wind angle can be viewed as changing the wind farm layout relative to the incoming wind, while keeping the same wind turbine density. Of particular importance is the effect of wind direction on the distance available for the wakes to recover and expand before encountering other downwind turbines (in full-wake or partial-wake interactions), which affects the power losses from those turbines. As a result, even small changes in wind direction angle can have strong impacts on the total wind farm power output. For example, a change in wind direction of just 10◦ from the worst-case full-wake condition is found to increase the total power output by as much as 43{\%}. This has important implications for the design of wind farms and the management of the temporal variability of their power output.},

Firstly, probability models are proposed for the natural variability of wind resources that include air density, mean wind velocity and associated Weibull parameters, surface roughness exponent, and error for prediction of long-term wind velocity based on the Measure–Correlate–Predict method. An empirical probability model for a power performance curve is also demonstrated. Secondly, a Monte-Carlo based numerical simulation procedure which utilizes the probability models is presented. From the numerical simulation, it is found that the present method can effectively evaluate the expected annual energy production for different averaging periods and confidence intervals. The uncertainty, which is 11{\%} corresponding to the normalized average energy production in the present example, can be calculated by specifically considering the characteristics of the individual sources in terms of probability parameters.},

abstract = {In wind turbine fatigue design, it is customary to use the partial safety factor approach: loads are inflated by some factor, while material fatigue strength is decreased in calculations. Values for partial factors used originally come from civil engineering standards for utility buildings and bridges, and it is not clear that they are optimal for wind turbines. In the paper, an inventory of important stochastic parameters influencing fatigue loads is given, and their estimated distributions are presented. With this information, failure probabilities due to fatigue are determined, as well as the relative importance of the stochastic parameters for total uncertainty. Using a simple cost model, economically optimal failure probabilities and partial factors are derived. The main conclusion of the presented work is that uncertainties in material fatigue properties and life prediction methods dominate total uncertainty, and hence determine the required partial factors.

abstract = {The probability density function (PDF) of wind speed is important in numerous wind energy applications. A large number of studies have been published in scientific literature related to renewable energies that propose the use of a variety of PDFs to describe wind speed frequency distributions. In this paper a review of these PDFs is carried out. The flexibility and usefulness of the PDFs in the description of different wind regimes (high frequencies of null winds, unimodal, bimodal, bitangential regimes, etc.) is analysed for a wide collection of models. Likewise, the methods that have been used to estimate the parameters on which these models depend are reviewed and the degree of complexity of the estimation is analysed in function of the model selected: these are the method of moments (MM), the maximum likelihood method (MLM) and the least squares method (LSM). In addition, a review is conducted of the statistical tests employed to see whether a sample of wind data comes from a population with a particular probability distribution. With the purpose of cataloguing the various PDFs, a comparison is made between them and the two parameter Weibull distribution (W.pdf), which has been the most widely used and accepted distribution in the specialised literature on wind energy and other renewable energy sources. This comparison is based on: (a) an analysis of the degree of fit of the continuous cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for wind speed to the cumulative relative frequency histograms of hourly mean wind speeds recorded at weather stations located in the Canarian Archipelago; (b) an analysis of the degree of fit of the CDFs for wind power density to the cumulative relative frequency histograms of the cube of hourly mean wind speeds recorded at the aforementioned weather stations. The suitability of the distributions is judged from the coefficient of determination R2. Amongst the various conclusions obtained, it can be stated that the W.pdf presents a series of advantages with respect to the other PDFs analysed. However, the W.pdf cannot represent all the wind regimes encountered in nature such as, for example, those with high percentages of null wind speeds, bimodal distributions, etc. Therefore, its generalised use is not justified and it will be necessary to select the appropriate PDF for each wind regime in order to minimise errors in the estimation of the energy produced by a WECS (wind energy conversion system). In this sense, the extensive collection of PDFs proposed in this paper comprises a valuable catalogue.},

abstract = {A very flexible joint probability density function of wind speed and direction is presented in this paper for use in wind energy analysis. A method that enables angular-linear distributions to be obtained with specified marginal distributions has been used for this purpose. For the marginal distribution of wind speed we use a singly truncated from below Normal-Weibull mixture distribution. The marginal distribution of wind direction comprises a finite mixture of von Mises distributions. The proposed model is applied in this paper to wind direction and wind speed hourly data recorded at several weather stations located in the Canary Islands (Spain). The suitability of the distributions is judged from the coefficient of determination R2. The conclusions reached are that the joint distribution proposed in this paper: (a) can represent unimodal, bimodal and bitangential wind speed frequency distributions, (b) takes into account the frequency of null winds, (c) represents the wind direction regimes in zones with several modes or prevailing wind directions, (d) takes into account the correlation between wind speeds and its directions. It can therefore be used in several tasks involved in the evaluation process of the wind resources available at a potential site. We also conclude that, in the case of the Canary Islands, the proposed model provides better fits in all the cases analysed than those obtained with the models used in the specialised literature on wind energy. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A large number of problems in production planning and scheduling, location, transportation, finance, and engineering design require that decisions be made in the presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty, for instance, governs the prices of fuels, the availability of electricity, and the demand for chemicals. A key difficulty in optimization under uncertainty is in dealing with an uncertainty space that is huge and frequently leads to very large-scale optimization models. Decision-making under uncertainty is often further complicated by the presence of integer decision variables to model logical and other discrete decisions in a multi-period or multi-stage setting. This paper reviews theory and methodology that have been developed to cope with the complexity of optimization problems under uncertainty. We discuss and contrast the classical recourse-based stochastic programming, robust stochastic programming, probabilistic (chance-constraint) programming, fuzzy programming, and stochastic dynamic programming. The advantages and shortcomings of these models are reviewed and illustrated through examples. Applications and the state-of-the-art in computations are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss several main areas for future development in this field. These include development of polynomial-time approximation schemes for multi-stage stochastic programs and the application of global optimization algorithms to two-stage and chance-constraint formulations. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is based on an immersed boundary type technique where volume forces are used to intro- duce wind shear and atmospheric turbulence. The application of the model for wake studies is demonstrated by combining it with the actuator line method, and predictions are compared with field measurements.

abstract = {Thispaper presents a mathematical framework to properly account for uncertaintyin wind resource assessment and wind energy production estimation. Ameteorological tower based wind measurement campaign is considered exclusively, inwhich measure-correlate-predict is used to estimate the long-term wind resource.The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimationof the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertainprocess. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, frommeasuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a powercurve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judgingthe feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development.The approach in this paper provides a framework for anaccurate and objective accounting of uncertainty and, therefore, better decisionmaking when assessing a potential wind energy site. It doesnot investigate the values of individual uncertainty sources. Three majoraspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, amethod is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessingthe wind resource. Second, methods for handling uncertainty sources inwind turbine power output and energy losses are presented. Third,a new method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty whenusing a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonlyassumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should bescaled by a factor between 2 and 3 to yieldthe uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that thisassumption is an oversimplification and also presents a closed formsolution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters. {\textcopyright}2008 American Society of Mechanical Engineers},

abstract = {The production of wind energy often involves uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of wind speeds and the variation of the power curve. The latter occurs when a fleet of wind turbine generators (WTG) of the same type are deployed in the wind farm, yet each generator may produce different amounts of powers given the same wind speed. This paper aims to characterize the dynamics of the wind energy production and estimate the power uncertainty when a WTG operates between the cut-in wind speed and the rated wind speed. We propose a probabilistic model to characterize the dynamics of the output power assuming the power follows the normal distribution with a varying mean and a constant standard deviation. Based on that condition, the mean and the variance for the total wind energy production are derived by incorporating the stochastic wind speed and the power dynamics. Both simulations and numerical examples are provided to verify and illustrate the new model, respectively.},

abstract = {Abstract The deep water gas development offshore Tanzania in East Africa is characterized by water depth of up to 2600 meters combined with a seabed consisting of deep, large scale canyons and steep inclinations towards the shore. The reservoir fluids are very dry and the pipeline flow is typically low liquid loading conditions at which multiple holdup solutions exist. Previous experience has shown that the OLGA model is not predicting well at these conditions and that very little experimental data exist for such conditions. Hence the experimental “Large Scale Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests” campaign was carried out at the SINTEF Tiller large scale test facility, followed up by the “Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study” with Schlumberger SPTC. This presentation gives an overview of the Tanzania deep water gas development with focus on the flow assurance challenges relates to a Subsea to Beach concept. The background, motivation and scope of work for the two studies “Large Scale Low Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests (SINTEF)” and “Tanzania Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study” (Schlumberger SPTC) are given, while the results are presented in detail in separate presentations. Introduction The Tanzania Gas Project (TGP) is located in Block 2 approximately 100km offshore Tanzania in East Africa (ref Figure 1). Statoil Tanzania AS is the operator in Block 2 with 65{\%} interest with ExxonMobil as a partner with 35{\%} interest. Locations of the Block 2 discoveries are shown in Figure 1. The objective of the project is to develop the core area of Block 2 by producing gas offshore, transporting it to shore and feeding an onshore Joint Venture (JV) Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant. The onshore JV is between the operators of Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. BG Group (BG) is the operator of Blocks 1, 3 and 4. As of 1Q 2015, eight reservoirs have been discovered in Block 2: Zafarani, Lavani Main, Lavani Deep, Tangawizi, Mronge, Mdalasini, Giligiliani and Piri. This paper gives an overview of the Tanzania deep water gas development with a focus on the flow assurance challenges relating to a Subsea to Beach concept, and then especially related to multiphase flow modelling. The reservoir fluids are very dry and the pipeline flow is typically low liquid loading conditions at which multiple holdup solutions exist. Experience has shown that the “standard” OLGA model is not predicting well at these conditions (ref Figure 11) and that very little experimental data exist for such conditions. The background, motivation and scope of work for the two studies “Large Scale Low Liquid Loading Two-phase Flow Tests (SINTEF)” and Tanzania Core Model Evaluation and Flow Assurance Risk Study (Schlumberger SPTC) are given, whilst the results are presented in detail in separate papers (ref /14/, /15/, /16/ and /17/), each presenting in detail the studies that have been carried out as part of the Tanzania flow model verification work.},

abstract = {Emerging stochastic analysis methods are of potentially great benefit for wind turbine power output and loads analysis. Instead of requiring multiple (e.g. ten-minute) deterministic simulations, a stochastic approach can enable quick assessment of a turbine's long term performance (e.g. 20 year fatigue and extreme loads) from a single stochastic simulation. However, even though the wind inflow is often described as a stochastic process, the common spectral formulation requires a large number of random variables to be considered. This is a major issue for stochastic methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality leading to a steep performance drop with an increasing number of random variables contained in the governing equations. In this paper a novel engineering wind model is developed which reduces the number of random variables by 4{\&}ndash;5 orders of magnitude compared to typical models while retaining proper spatial correlation of wind speed sample points across a wind turbine rotor. The new model can then be used as input to direct stochastic simulations models under development. A comparison of the new method to results from the commercial code TurbSim and a custom implementation of the standard spectral model shows that for a 3D wind field the most important properties (cross-correlation, covariance, auto- and cross-spectrum) are conserved adequately by the proposed method.},

Firstly, the case with the flow direction being parallel to rows in a rectangu- lar geometry is considered by defining three flow regimes.Secondly,when the flow is not in line with the main rows, solutions are suggested for the patterns of wind turbine units cor- responding to each wind direction.The presentation is an outline of a model complex that will be adjusted and calibrated with measurements in the near future.},

Classic designs were developed for real, non-simulated systems in agriculture, engineering, etc. These designs assume 'a few' factors (no more than 10 factors) with only 'a few' values per factor (no more than five values). These designs are mostly incomplete factorials (e.g., fractionals). The resulting input/output (I/O) data are analyzed through polynomial metamodels, which are a type of linear regression models. Modern designs were developed for simulated systems in engineering, management science, etc. These designs allow 'many factors (more than 100), each with either a few or 'many' (more than 100) values. These designs include group screening, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), and other 'space filling' designs. Their I/O data are analyzed through second-order polynomials for group screening, and through Kriging models for LHS. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of simulation-based uncertainty propagation approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation method) can be computationally expensive if evaluating the function requires a relatively large computation time. To reduce the computation time, uncertainty propagation methods that use surrogate models (e.g., the Kriging method) may be used. In this paper, we extend the Kriging method to propagate the uncertainties from multiple sources, and for cases where the distribution of the prediction is produced at each trial (replication) of the simulation-based uncertainty propagation approach (i.e., at each sample point). The outputs of the methodology are the approximate percentiles of the output distribution. The capability of the methodology is tested using a Case Study involving the transport of solid particles in pipelines to prevent solid particle deposition and improve pipeline efficiency. Statistical comparisons suggest that our methodology successfully replicates the outputs from the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 94{\%} reduction in computational cost.},

abstract = {Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a relatively new research area which describes the methods and approaches used to supply quantitative descriptions of the effects of uncertainty, variability and errors in simulation problems and models. It is rapidly becoming a field of increasing importance, with many real-world applications within statistics, mathematics, probability and engineering, but also within the natural sciences. Literature on the topic has up until now been largely based on polynomial chaos, which raises difficulties when considering different types of approximation and does not lead to a unified presentation of the methods. Moreover, this description does not consider either deterministic problems or infinite dimensional ones. This book gives a unified, practical and comprehensive presentation of the main techniques used for the characterization of the effect of uncertainty on numerical models and on their exploitation in numerical problems. In particular, applications to linear and nonlinear systems of equations, differential equations, optimization and reliability are presented. Applications of stochastic methods to deal with deterministic numerical problems are also discussed. Matlab?? illustrates the implementation of these methods and makes the book suitable as a textbook and for self-study. Discusses the main ideas of Stochastic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification using Functional Analysis.

abstract = {Multiphase computational fluid dynamics plays a major role in design and optimization of fossil fuel based reactors. There is a growing interest in accounting for the influence of uncertainties associated with physical systems to increase the reliability of computational simulation based engineering analysis. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has recently undertaken an initiative to characterize uncertainties associated with computer simulation of reacting multiphase flows encountered in energy producing systems such as a coal gasifier. The current work presents the preliminary results in applying non-intrusive parametric uncertainty quantification and propagation techniques with NETL's open-source multiphase computational fluid dynamics software MFIX. For this purpose an open-source uncertainty quantification toolkit, PSUADE developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has been interfaced with MFIX software. In this study, the sources of uncertainty associated with numerical approximation and model form have been neglected, and only the model input parametric uncertainty with forward propagation has been investigated by constructing a surrogate model based on data-fitted response surface for a multiphase flow demonstration problem. Monte Carlo simulation was employed for forward propagation of the aleatory type input uncertainties. Several insights gained based on the outcome of these simulations are presented such as how inadequate characterization of uncertainties can affect the reliability of the prediction results. Also a global sensitivity study using Sobol' indices was performed to better understand the contribution of input parameters to the variability observed in response variable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Slug flow is one of the common flow patterns in gas and oil production and transportation. One of the closure relationships required by the multiphase flow mechanistic models is slug length correlation. There are several closure relationships proposed in the literature as function of pipe geometry, pipe diameter, and inclination angle, and to a lesser extent to the flow rates and fluid properties. In this paper, we show that most of the frequently used mechanistic models are insensitive to slug length information. The only exception to this is identified as the Zhang  (2003, “Unified Model for Gas-Liquid Pipe Flow via Slug Dynamics—Part 1: Model Development,” ASME J. Energy Resour. Technol., 125 , pp. 266–272). The unified model shows sensitivity at high gas flow rates, while displaying a negligible sensitivity at low gas flow rates. In conclusion, the slug length closure relationship is not crucial for pressure loss and holdup calculations. It can be speculated that the success of the unit cell slug flow modeling approach could be attributed to insensitivity of the models to slug length considering the highly probabilistic nature of the slug length.},

abstract = {We propose a modeling paradigm, termed field inversion and machine learning (FIML), that seeks to comprehensively harness data from sources such as high-fidelity simulations and experiments to aid the creation of improved closure models for computational physics applications. In contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been performed over a number of problems that are representative of the deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties.},

abstract = {Wind energy shows a great promise to be a major supplier of clean energy. However, to stay financially competitive with other sources of energy, its cost needs to be further reduced. Unlike the traditional energy resources that have good certainty in predicting the amount and cost of generated electricity, wind energy shows large uncertainties due to several uncertain input parameters. These uncertainties increase the financial investment risks, and thereby introduce higher interest rates that adds up to the cost. This study investigates the influence of the meteorological input parameters on the levelized cost of energy for a 20 MW research wind turbine. These uncertain input parameters are the wind shear, air density, average wind speed and Weibull shape parameter. Aeroservoelastic simulations are performed to evaluate the levelized cost of energy. C-type Gram Charlier series function is used to assess the probability density of levelized cost of energy. For computational efficiency, dimensional reduction technique is employed to compute the raw moments. The results of this study show that the average wind speed and air density have a high influence on the levelized cost of energy in terms of both the magnitude and occurrence of the probability density function. While the deterministic levelized cost of energy for the 20 MW wind turbine design is computed to be 3.45 USCents/kWHr, the probabilistic results of this research only consider 15.9{\%} probability of occurrence for such a value, with a cumulative chance of 3.3{\%} for the levelized cost of energy to be less than 3.45 USCents/kWHr due to uncertain input parameters.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a model-free optimization algorithm to improve the total wind farm power production in a cooperative game framework. Conventionally, for a given wind condition, an individual wind turbine maximizes its own power production without taking into consideration the conditions of other wind turbines. Under this greedy control strategy, the wake formed by the upstream wind turbine, due to the reduced wind speed and the increased turbulence intensity inside the wake, would affect and lower the power productions of the downstream wind turbines. To increase the overall wind farm power production, researchers have proposed cooperative wind turbine control approaches to coordinate the actions that mitigate the wake interference among the wind turbines and thus increase the total wind farm power production. This study explores the use of a data-driven optimization approach to identify the optimum coordinated control actions in real time using limited amount of data. Specifically, we propose the Bayesian Ascent (BA) method that combines the strengths of Bayesian optimization and trust region optimization algorithms. Using Gaussian Process regression, BA requires only a few number of data points to model the complex target system. Furthermore, due to the use of trust region constraint on sampling procedure, BA tends to increase the target value and converge toward near the optimum. Simulation studies using analytical functions show that the BA method can achieve an almost monotone increase in a target value with rapid convergence. BA is also implemented and tested in a laboratory setting to maximize the total power using two scaled wind turbine models.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {A new analytical wake model is proposed and validated to predict the wind velocity distribution downwind of a wind turbine. The model is derived by applying conservation of mass and momentum and assuming a Gaussian distribution for the velocity deficit in the wake. This simple model only requires one parameter to determine the velocity distribution in the wake. The results are compared to high-resolution wind-tunnel measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data of miniature wind-turbine wakes, as well as LES data of real-scale wind-turbine wakes. In general, it is found that the velocity deficit in the wake predicted by the proposed analytical model is in good agreement with the experimental and LES data. The results also show that the new model predicts the power extracted by downwind wind turbines more accurately than other common analytical models, some of which are based on less accurate assumptions like considering a top-hat shape for the velocity deficit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model is derived by applying conservation of mass and momentum in the context of actuator disk theory, and assuming a distribution of the double-Gaussian type for the velocity deficit in the wake.

The ancillary services considered in this paper consist of actively controlling the power output of the wind turbines to track power set-point commands, participate in frequency regulation, and provide frequency response. This paper focuses on the development of a wind turbine control system that is capable of varying the turbine's active power output upon receiving de-rating power set-point commands, manual power commands, and automatic frequency regulation commands to meet the system operators' needs in below-rated and above-rated wind speeds. The turbine is de-rated by operating at a higher than optimal tip speed ratio, storing additional inertia in the rotor, which can be used to assist in frequency regulation by providing a primary response to fluctuations in the grid frequency.},

abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinato-rially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series mea-surements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computation-ally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems of mathematical physics including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. More-over, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable. PACS numbers: 05.45.-a, 05.45.Yv Data-driven discovery methods, which have been en-abled in the last decade by the plummeting cost of sen-sors, data storage and computational resources, are hav-ing a transformative impact on the sciences, enabling a variety of innovations for characterizing high dimen-sional data generated from experiments. Less well under-stood is how to uncover underlying physical laws and/or governing equations from time series data that exhibit spatio-temporal activity. Traditional theoretical meth-ods for deriving the underlying partial differential equa-tions (PDEs) are rooted in conservation laws, physical principles and/or phenomenological behaviors. These first principle derivations lead to many of the canonical models of mathematical physics. However, there remain many complex systems that have eluded quantitative an-alytic descriptions or even characterization of a suitable choice of variables (e.g. neuroscience, power grid, epi-demiology, finance, ecology, etc). We propose an alter-native method to derive governing equations based solely on time series data collected at a fixed number of spa-tial locations. Using innovations in sparse regression, we discover the terms of the governing PDE that most accu-rately represent the data from a large library of potential candidate functions. Importantly, measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics. We demonstrate the success of the method by deriving, from time series data alone, many canonical models of mathematical physics. Methods for data-driven discovery of dynamical},

@article{Soepyan2013,
abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to introduce a methodology for determining the models that predict accurate threshold velocities for solid particle transport in a pipeline at a given operating condition. Methods: The proposed methodology consists of: (1) a data clustering approach that selects the data points from the experimental database that best represent the specified operating condition; (2) a model parameter fine-tuning module that adjusts the parameters of the models using the selected data to increase the models' accuracy within the range of the operating condition; and (3) a model ranking approach that uses statistical analyses to determine the appropriate models for the operating condition. Results: This methodology is validated using 164 experimental data points for horizontal (or near-horizontal), solid/liquid flow at low particle concentrations as operating conditions. The methodology generates underestimates of the threshold velocity for 38{\%} of the above-mentioned operating conditions, compared to 45{\%} for the Mantz (1977) model and 52{\%} for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model; and produces velocity predictions exceeding??50{\%} of the experimental velocity for only 10{\%} of the operating conditions, compared to 27{\%} for the Mantz (1977) model and 35{\%} for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model. Conclusion: The proposed methodology improves the accuracy of threshold velocity predictions compared to using conventional models. Practice implications: Initiating the motion of solid particles from the bottom of horizontal pipelines at low particle concentrations has been a topic of interest due to the desire to prevent the accumulation of solid particles in pipes. In order to initiate the movement of the particles, the magnitude of the velocity of the single-phase fluid must be equal to at least that of the threshold velocity for particle motion. There are multiple models that predict the threshold velocity, but for the same operating condition, the velocity estimations of these models might differ by orders of magnitude. Therefore, at a given operating condition, it is necessary to determine the models that best predict the threshold velocity. The methodology proposed in this paper successfully identifies the most accurate models to use at a given operating condition. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work, we present results of a large-eddy simulation of the 48 multi-megawatt turbines composing the Lillgrund wind plant. Turbulent inflow wind is created by performing an atmospheric boundary layer precursor simulation, and turbines are modeled using a rotating, variable-speed actuator line representation. The motivation for this work is that few others have done large-eddy simulations of wind plants with a substantial number of turbines, and the methods for carrying out the simulations are varied. We wish to draw upon the strengths of the existing simulations and our growing atmospheric large-eddy simulation capability to create a sound methodology for performing this type of simulation. We used the OpenFOAM CFD toolbox to create our solver. The simulated time-averaged power production of the turbines in the plant agrees well with field observations, except with the sixth turbine and beyond in each wind-aligned. The power produced by each of those turbines is overpredicted by 25-40{\%}. A direct comparison between simulated and field data is difficult because we simulate one wind direction with a speed and turbulence intensity characteristic of Lillgrund, but the field observations were taken over a year of varying conditions. The simulation shows the significant 60-70{\%} decrease in the performance of the turbines behind the front row in this plant that has a spacing of 4.3 rotor diameters in this direction. The overall plant efficiency is well predicted. This work shows the importance of using local grid refinement to simultaneously capture the meter-scale details of the turbine wake and the kilometer-scale turbulent atmospheric structures. Although this work illustrates the power of large-eddy simulation in producing a time-accurate solution, it required about one million processor-hours, showing the significant cost of large-eddy simulation.

abstract = {This article develops a general framework for identifying error and uncertainty in computational simulations that deal with the numerical solution of a set of partial differential equations (PDEs). A comprehensive, new view of the general phases of modeling and simulation is proposed, consisting of the following phases: conceptual modeling of the physical system, mathematical modeling of the conceptual model, discretization and algorithm selection for the mathematical model, computer programming of the discrete model, numerical solution of the computer program model, and representation of the numerical solution. Our view incorporates the modeling and simulation phases that are recognized in the systems engineering and operations research communities, but it adds phases that are specific to the numerical solution of PDEs. In each of these phases, general sources of uncertainty, both aleatory and epistemic, and error are identified. Our general framework is applicable to any numerical discretization procedure for solving ODEs or PDEs. To demonstrate this framework, we describe a system-level example: the flight of an unguided, rocket-boosted, aircraft-launched missile. This example is discussed in detail at each of the six phases of modeling and simulation. Two alternative models of the flight dynamics are considered, along with aleatory uncertainty of the initial mass of the missile and epistemic uncertainty in the thrust of the rocket motor. We also investigate the interaction of modeling uncertainties and numerical integration error in the solution of the ordinary differential equations for the flight dynamics.},

To this aim, a data-driven RANS approach is proposed in order to achieve very low computational costs and adequate accuracy through the data assimilation procedure. The RANS simulations are implemented with a classical Boussinesq hypothesis and a mixing length turbulence closure model, which is calibrated through the available data. High-fidelity LES simulations of a utility-scale wind turbine operating with different tip speed ratios are used as database. It is shown that the mixing length model for the RANS simulations can be calibrated accurately through the Reynolds stress of the axial and radial velocity components, and the gradient of the axial velocity in the radial direction. It is found that the mixing length is roughly invariant in the very near wake, then it increases linearly with the downstream distance in the diffusive region. The variation rate of the mixing length in the downstream direction is proposed as a criterion to detect the transition between near wake and transition region of a wind turbine wake. Finally, RANS simulations were performed with the calibrated mixing length model, and a good agreement with the LES simulations is observed.},

The ROM enables to capture the main physical processes underpinning the downstream evolution and dynamics of wind turbine wakes. The ROM is then embedded within a Kalman filter in order to produce a time-marching algorithm for prediction of wind turbine wake flows. This data-driven algorithm enables data assimilation of new measurements simultaneously to the wake prediction, which leads to an improved accuracy and a dynamic update of the ROM in presence of emerging coherent wake dynamics observed from new available data.

The individual wind turbines are considered as flow actuators, and their energy extraction is dynamically regulated in time, so as to optimally influence the flow field. We extend earlier work on wind farm optimal control in the fully-developed regime (Goit and Meyers 2015, J. Fluid Mech. 768, 5–50) to a `finite' wind farm case, in which entrance effects play an important role. For the optimal control, a receding horizon framework is employed in which turbine thrust coefficients are optimized in time and per turbine. Optimization is performed with a conjugate gradient method, where gradients of the cost functional are obtained using adjoint large eddy simulations. Overall, the energy extraction is increased 7{\%} by the optimal control. This increase in energy extraction is related to faster wake recovery throughout the farm. For the first row of turbines, the optimal control increases turbulence levels and Reynolds stresses in the wake, leading to better wake mixing and an inflow velocity for the second row that is significantly higher than in the uncontrolled case. For downstream rows, the optimal control mainly enhances the sideways mean transport of momentum. This is different from earlier observations by Goit and Meyers (2015) in the fully-developed regime, where mainly vertical transport was enhanced.},

For the optimization of the wind-turbine controls, a conjugate-gradient optimization method is used in combination with adjoint large-eddy simulations for the determination of the gradients of the cost functional. In a first control study, wind-farm energy extraction is optimized in an aligned wind farm. Results are accumulated over one hour of operation. We find that the energy extraction is increased by 16 {\%} compared to the uncontrolled reference. This is directly related to an increase of the vertical fluxes of energy towards the wind turbines, and vertical shear stresses increase considerably. A further analysis, decomposing the total stresses into dispersive and Reynolds stresses, shows that the dispersive stresses increase drastically, and that the Reynolds stresses decrease on average, but increase in the wake region, leading to better wake recovery. We further observe also that turbulent dissipation levels in the boundary layer increase, and overall the outer layer of the boundary layer enters into a transient decelerating regime, while the inner layer and the turbine region attain a new statistically steady equilibrium within approximately one wind-farm through-flow time. Two additional optimal control cases study penalization of turbulent dissipation. For the current wind-farm geometry, it is found that the ratio between wind-farm energy extraction and turbulent boundary-layer dissipation remains roughly around 70 {\%}, but can be slightly increased by a few per cent by penalizing the dissipation in the optimization objective. For a pressure-driven boundary layer in equilibrium, we estimate that such a shift can lead to an increase in wind-farm energy extraction of 6 {\%}.},

abstract = {In the field of uncertainty quantification, uncertainty in the governing equations may assume two forms: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty can be characterised by known probability distributions whilst epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge of probabilistic information. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the numerical treatment of aleatory uncertainty, little attention has been given to the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a numerical framework for quantification of epistemic uncertainty. The proposed methodology does not require any probabilistic information on uncertain input parameters. The method only necessitates an estimate of the range of the uncertain variables that encapsulates the true range of the input variables with overwhelming probability. To quantify the epistemic uncertainty, we solve an encapsulation problem, which is a solution to the original governing equations defined on the estimated range of the input variables. We discuss solution strategies for solving the encapsulation problem and the sufficient conditions under which the numerical solution can serve as a good estimator for capturing the effects of the epistemic uncertainty. In the case where probability distributions of the epistemic variables become known a posteriori, we can use the information to post-process the solution and evaluate solution statistics. Convergence results are also established for such cases, along with strategies for dealing with mixed aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure and properties of the proposed methodology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Moreover, the accuracy of the representation improves no matter the regularity of the random quantity of interest. Therefore, the method is particularly well suited when nonlinear transformations of random variables are in play and can be viewed as a new way of tackling the Gibbs phenomenon. We apply the method to several test cases with different levels of regularity, dimensionality and complexity, including the case of compressible gas dynamics and long time-integration problems.

Our method also allows us to examine the structural error in the CLM under two error models.

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian inference. Although typically less accurate than, for example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because they do not require the specification of a likelihood function. For this reason considerable amounts of data can be analysed and more complex models can be used providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model to the data. Since its first applications in the late 1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The framework was originally developed to solve problems in population genetics. However, as its efficiency was recognized its popularity increased and, consequently, it started to be used in fields as diverse as phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is still being greatly studied and alterations to it are being proposed, the statistical approach has already reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the number of related computer packages that are being developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the expansion of the use of this method can only increase. In this paper we are going to depict the context that led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to describe its current usage in such field and present its most recent developments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical approach to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and wind energy production estimation. The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a power curve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development. Many current methods for assessing uncertainty either oversimplify the process or make faulty assumptions, leading to erroneous estimates of uncertainty. The approach in this paper yields a more accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty, and therefore better decision making when assessing a potential wind energy site. Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, uncertainty in wind turbine power output and energy production is characterized. Third, a method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty when using a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonly assumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should be scaled by a factor between two and three to yield the uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that this assumption is an oversimplification, and also presents a closed form solution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters.},

Leja sequences are arbitrarily granular (any number of nodes may be added to a current sequence, producing a new sequence) and thus are a good choice for the univariate composite rule used to construct adaptive sparse grids in high dimensions. When undertaking stochastic collocation one is often interested in constructing weighted approximation where the weights are determined by the probability densities of the random variables. This paper establishes that a certain weighted formulation of one-dimensional Leja sequences produces a sequence of nodes whose empirical distribution converges to the corresponding limiting distribution of the Gauss quadrature nodes associated with the weight function. This property is true even for unbounded domains. We apply the Leja-sparse grid approach to several high-dimensional and problems and demonstrate that Leja sequences are often superior to more standard sparse grid constructions (e.g. Clenshaw-Curtis), at least for interpolatory metrics.},

abstract = {Feedforward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons are popular tools for nonlinear regression and classification problems. From a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be viewed as defining a prior probability distribution over non-linear functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but otherwise standard networks, Neal (1996) has shown that the prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network model determine the characteristic length scales of the Gaussian process. Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. In this chapter I will review work on this idea by Williams and Rasmussen (1996), Neal (1997), Barber and Williams (1997) and Gibbs and MacKay (1997), and will assess whether, for supervised regression and classification tasks, the feedforward network has been superceded.},

Our sensitivity methodology relies on the non-intrusive approach of the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method; the gPC is a spectral non-statistical numerical method well-suited to representing random processes not restricted to Gaussian fields. The analysis is carried out at Re$\lambda$=100 and for different grid resolutions and Cs distributions. Numerical predictions are also compared to direct numerical simulation evidence. We have shown that the different turbulent scales of the LES solution respond differently to the variability in Cs. In particular, the study of the relative turbulent kinetic energy distributions for different Cs distributions indicates that small scales are mainly affected by changes in the subgrid-model parametric uncertainty.},

Three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated: support vector machines, Adaboost decision trees, and random forests. The algorithms were trained on a database of canonical flow configurations for which validated direct numerical simulation or large eddy simulation results were available, and were used to classify RANS results on a point-by-point basis as having either high or low uncertainty, based on the breakdown of specific RANS$\backslash$nmodeling assumptions. Classifiers were developed for three different basic RANS$\backslash$neddy$\backslash$nviscosity$\backslash$nmodel assumptions: the isotropy of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity, the linearity of the Boussinesq hypothesis, and the non-negativity of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity. It is shown that these classifiers are able to generalize to flows substantially different from those on which they were trained. Feature selection techniques, model evaluation, and extrapolation detection are discussed in the context of turbulence modeling applications.},

abstract = {In this study, an efficient Bayesian method based on the adaptive sparse grid interpolation is used to solve the contaminant source identification problem. The unknown parameters that characterize the contaminant source are treated as random variables and identified by the Bayesian approach. To alleviate the computational burden in the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, a surrogate system with the polynomial form is constructed by the stochastic collocation method (SCM), which employs the interpolation based on the sparse grids rather than those based on the full tensor product. Furthermore, an adaptive scheme is used to take the different importance of the parameters into account. Therefore, the computational burden is significantly reduced. Once the surrogate system is determined, the likelihood can be evaluated by sampling the surrogate system directly, with very little computational cost. To improve the accuracy, we propose an auxiliary SCM based approach, where the surrogate system serves as a guidance for the fast adaption of the proposal distribution in the MCMC method. Numerical cases show that, under certain conditions, this method can greatly reduce the computational burden in the MCMC sampling and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant source. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real-time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors.},

Therefore, there is a continuous need to find a 'good' wake model to properly plan wind power plant-level control strategies, predict the performance and understand the fatigue loads of turbines. In this paper, six widely used approaches of wake modelling (Jensen, Larsen, Dynamic Wake Meandering, Fuga and, Ellipsys3D LES and RANS together with their interpretations) that were developed at Technical University of Denmark, are described and the model subcomponents are analysed. The models are evaluated using data from the Sexbierum (onshore) and the Lillgrund (offshore) wind farms to understand how to best utilize them. The paper provides a comprehensive conceptual background to wake modelling combined with the overview of the state-of-the-art models including their implementations on operating wind farms.},

abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering application. For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the models are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many fields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Wind tunnel measurements were performed for the wake produced by a three-bladed wind turbine immersed in uniform flow. These tests show the presence of a vorticity structure in the near-wake region mainly oriented along the streamwise direction, which is denoted as the hub vortex. The hub vortex is characterized by oscillations with frequencies lower than that connected to the rotational velocity of the rotor, which previous works have ascribed to wake meandering. This phenomenon consists of transversal oscillations of the wind turbine wake, which might be excited by the vortex shedding from the rotor disc acting as a bluff body. In this work, temporal and spatial linear stability analyses of a wind turbine wake are performed on a base flow obtained with time-averaged wind tunnel velocity measurements. This study shows that the low-frequency spectral component detected experimentally matches the most amplified frequency of the counter-winding single-helix mode downstream of the wind turbine. Then, simultaneous hot-wire measurements confirm the presence of a helicoidal unstable mode of the hub vortex with a streamwise wavenumber roughly equal to that predicted from the linear stability analysis.},

Unlike the conventional explicit integration schemes, it is not based on a standard CFL condition. Instead, the eigenvalues of the dynamical system are analytically bounded and the linear stability domain of the time-integration scheme is adapted in order to maximize the time step. The method works independently of the underlying spatial mesh; therefore, it can be easily integrated into structured or unstructured codes. The additional computational cost is minimal, and a significant increase of the time step is achieved without losing accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated on both a Cartesian staggered and an unstructured collocated formulation. In practice, CPU cost reductions up to more than 4 with respect to the conventional approach have been measured.},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of a drag-reducing polymer on oil-water flow patterns and pressure gradients was investigated in a downward-inclined pipe (-5??) and compared with the results obtained in a horizontal pipe for the same flow characteristics. Drag reduction was achieved by adding 40. ppm of polymer into an oil-water flow in an acrylic pipe of 0.0306. m ID flowing at 0.1-1.6. m/s mixture velocities and 0.05-0.9 input oil volume fractions. The downward inclination enhanced the mixing of the two phases and hence the boundaries between the dispersed and separated flows occurred at lower mixture velocities in downward flow than in horizontal flow. In both pipe orientations, the addition of the DRP affects the flow patterns and pressure gradients mainly in the water-dominated flow regions. Compared with those of the horizontal flow, the effect of polymer addition on flow pattern boundaries was generally lower at -5?? inclination. The effect of the polymer on the pressure gradients was more pronounced at horizontal flow than at -5?? flow, resulting in a maximum drag reduction of 64{\%} and 55{\%} at horizontal and -5?? flows, respectively. Since the polymer used is water-soluble, there were no observable changes in the flow characteristics at the oil-dominated flow regions.},

abstract = {Recently, due to an increase in production demand in nuclear and oil and gas industries, the requirement to migrate toward larger pipe sizes for future developments has become essential. However, it is interesting to note that almost all the research on two-phase gas–liquid flow in vertical pipe upflow is based on small-diameter pipes (D ≤ 100 mm), and the experimental work on the two-phase gas–liquid flow in large-diameter (D {\textgreater} 100 mm) vertical pipes is scarce. Under the above circumstances, the application of modeling tools/correlations based on small-diameter pipes in predicting flow behavior (flow pattern, void fraction, and pressure gradient) poses severe challenges in terms of accuracy. The results presented in this article are motivated by the need to introduce the research work done to the industries where the data pertaining to large-diameter vertical pipes are scarce and there is a lack of understanding of two-phase gas-liquid flow behavior in large-diameter (D {\textgreater} 100 mm) vertical pipes.The uniqu...},

abstract = {This note examines the modeling of non-convective fluxes (e.g., stress, heat flux and others) as they appear in the general, unclosed form of the volume-averaged equations of multiphase flows. By appealing to the difference between slowly and rapidly varying quantities, it is shown that the natural closure of these terms leads to the use of a single, slowly-varying combined average flux, common to both phases, plus rapidly-varying local contributions for each phase. The result is general and only rests on the hypothesis that the spatial variation of the combined average flux is adequately described by a linear function of position within the averaging volume. No further hypotheses on the nature of the flow (e.g., about specific flow regimes) prove necessary. The result agrees with earlier ones obtained by ensemble averaging, is illustrated with the example of disperse flows and discussed in the light of some earlier and current literature. A very concise derivation of the general averaged balance equation is also given.},

Based on the flow behavior research of multiphase flow in wellbore annuli, the liquid film zone was used as the control volume, and the effect of the tubing liquid film, casing liquid film and the droplets in gas core area on the mass and momentum transfers were considered. The mass and momentum conservation equations of slug and annular flows were obtained. Then the evaluation criterion of flow pattern transitions were established, including dispersed flow to slug flow, bubble flow to slug flow and slug flow to annular flow. The model prediction results were compared under the experimental conditions from the previous literatures. The predictions of flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient were compared between the new model and the pipe flow model modified by using the hydraulic diameter. The results show that the flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient can be predicted by the new model more accurately, and the prediction of liquid holdup and pressure gradient are better. ?? 2014 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration {\&} Development, PetroChina.},

@article{Labois2011b,
abstract = {A new turbulence modelling approach (Very-Large Eddy Simulation; V-LES) is developed and compared to conventional RANS and LES for a flow across a tube bundle. The method, which belongs to the large-scale simulation category, represents a good compromise between efficiency and precision, and may thus be used for industrial problems for which LES remains computationally expensive under high to very-high Reynolds number flow conditions. It can also be used for gas-liquid two-phase flows such as pressurized thermal shocks. The method is a sort of blend between U-RANS and LES, in that it resolves very large structures - way larger than the grid size - and models all subscale of turbulence using a two-equation model, by reference to RANS. The original model is shown here to share the same characteristics as the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach, in that when the filter width is smaller than the wall-distance at which viscous effects are negligible (f?? = 1), the fixed filter width is replaced by the wall distance. First conclusions to be drawn from its extension here is that the flow must be resolved in three-dimensions, under transient conditions, with refined grids. Sensitivity to various computational parameters has been addressed: grid, filter width, domain size, and inflow conditions. This modelling strategy is proved to provide the flow unsteadiness in three-dimensions, while saving computational cost compared to LES. The method is computationally efficient (it can be applied using an implicit solver which permits a higher CFL than with LES; typically 1 versus 0.1), and numerically robust. The computational cost decreases with increasing filter width, though at the expenses of the quality of the results. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A unified, asymptotically-preserving method for simulating multiphase flows using an exactly mass, momentum, and energy conserving Cell-Integrated Semi-Lagrangian advection algorithm is presented. The new algorithm uses a semi-implicit pressure update scheme that asymptotically preserves the standard incompressible pressure projection method in the limit of infinite sound speed. The asymptotically preserving attribute makes the new method applicable to compressible and incompressible flows, including stiff materials, which enables large time steps characteristic of incompressible flow algorithms rather than the small time steps required by explicit methods. Shocks are captured and material discontinuities are tracked, without the aid of any approximate or exact Riemann solvers. The new method enables one to simulate the flow of multiple materials, each possessing a potentially exotic equation of state. Simulations of multiphase flow in one and two dimensions are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm at efficiently computing multiphase flows containing shock waves and material discontinuities with large “impedance mismatch.” Additionally, new techniques related to the Moment-of-Fluid interface reconstruction are presented, including a novel, asymptotically-preserving method for capturing “filaments,” and an improved method for initializing the Moment-of-Fluid optimization problem on unstructured, triangular grids.},

The constitutive equations for the interfacial terms are the weakest link in a two-fluid model because of considerable difficulties in terms of experimentation and modeling. However, these are of supreme importance in determining phase interactions. In view of this, the interfacial transfer terms have been studied in great detail both for the three- and one-dimensional models. New interfacial area, drag, virtual mass, droplet size and entrainment correlations are presented. In the one-dimensional model, a number of serious shortcomings of the conventional model have been pointed out and new formulations to eliminate them are presented. These shortcomings mainly arose due to the improper consideration of phase distributions in the transverse direction. ?? 1984.},

For an assessment of both of these aspects an important theoretical framework is the concept of index. In this contribution we propose a new method for a systematic index reduction of quasi-linear PDAE systems. The general idea is to reveal quasi-linear combinations of the differential quantities in the high-index model which are invariant with respect to a specific independent variable. By using these quasi-linear combinations as templates for symbolic manipulations, additional algebraic constraints become explicit. These explicit constraints are then used for index reduction yielding low-index PDAE models. The procedure is demonstrated in the context of a typical modeling work-flow for modeling problems of a tubular reactor, diffusive charge transport in electrolyte mixtures and incompressible fluid flow.},

abstract = {Transient response due to gust loads can lead to structural failure despite the fact that the aero-elastic system is asymptotically stable. Unsteady aeroelastic analysis should therefore be included in the load calculation cycle of the aircraft design process. Especially in the transonic regime, partitioned strong coupling algorithms perform better than loose coupling algorithms and allow larger time-steps in the unsteady simulation. However, the simulation of high fidelity unsteady fluid-structure interaction using strong coupling algorithms is currently too expensive in order to be useful in industry.To accelerate high fidelity partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations we apply space-mapping, which is a technique that originates from the field of multi-fidelity optimization. Without loss of generality we assume the availability of a cheap low fidelity fluid solver and an expensive high fidelity fluid solver. The space-mapping approach is used to accelerate the high fidelity computation using black-box input/output information of both the high fidelity fluid solver and low fidelity fluid solver. In order to achieve this, a space-mapping function is defined on the fluid-structure interface which keeps track of the differences between the high fidelity model and the low fidelity model during the coupling iterations. Reformulating the root-finding problem on the fluid-structure interaction interface using the space-mapping function results in the Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm.The Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm is applied to 1-D and 2-D test cases in order to assess the speedup with respect to the Quasi-Newton Inverse Least Squares algorithm. The latter is considered to be the current state of the art in partitioned strong coupling algorithms. The observed speedup depends mainly on the type of FSI problem and the time step size. The maximum observed speedup is about 1.5.The application of the space-mapping technique to partitioned fluid-structure interaction problems is found to be a promising approach. The framework is non-intrusive and allows the reuse of existing solvers which is especially useful in an industrial environment. It is expected that the space-mapping technique can be combined with higher order time integration schemes that maintain accuracy over a large range of time step sizes.},

abstract = {The theory of port-Hamiltonian systems provides a framework for the geometric description of network models of physical systems. It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system. The port-Hamiltonian description offers a systematic framework for analysis, control and simulation of complex physical systems, for lumped-parameter as well as for distributed-parameter models.},

abstract = {A new parallel, computationally efficient immersed boundary method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta function approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike Peskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are used to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are solved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function techniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural free-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive grid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting operations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the immersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical discrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with specialized half-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently solve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum equation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems of equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved using an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic properties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to simple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are compatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference equations. Numerical experiments on low-aspect-ratio flat plates and spheres at Reynolds numbers up to 3,700 are used to verify the accuracy and physical fidelity of the formulation.},

In the present paper, we analyze 2-phase flows in vertical risers and demonstrate the capabilities of multi-dimensional modeling.{\'{y}} The prediction of vertical flows are very good except for low flow rates.{\'{y}} We demonstrate that complex flow regimes (such as churn flow) are predicted with the LedaFlow quasi three dimensional (Q3D) model, without resorting to assumptions about flow regimes and structures.{\'{y}} Q3D simulations show that small deviations from perfectly vertical flow may have a large effect on liquid hold-up and pressure drop.{\'{y}} The Q3D model is furthermore applied to simulate an operational situation where fluids are displaced to prevent hydrate formation during shut-down. Introduction Using the LedaFlow quasi three-dimensional (Q3D) model it is possible to predict complex flow regimes{\'{y}}such as{\'{y}}gravity-induced and hydrodynamic slugging, as well as transitional flow{\'{y}}(between wavy stratified and slug flow) in pipelines (Laux et al. 2008).{\'{y}}Prediction results for wavy stratified flow is presented in Laux et al. (2007). In this paper, we address churn flow in vertical and deviated risers as well as fluid displacement to prevent hydrate formation during a shut-down situation.{\'{y}}For multiphase flow in risers and wells, flow regimes are often very complex and can not be treated satisfactorily with 1D models.{\'{y}} One-dimensional (1D) models have been developed over the last 50 years to predict multiphase flows in pipelines. These models have been successful in assisting the industrial development but still have significant shortcomings due to simplifications and the use of empirical correlations. At the same time, new three-dimensional (3D) modeling techniques are developing fast, made possible by the continuous growth in available computational power.{\'{y}}3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models can give information that both qualitatively and even quantitatively surpasses information obtained from 1D models.},

abstract = {Periodic pigging of oil and gas pipelines for dewatering, cleaning and inspecting is a standard industry procedure. Predicting the motion of a pig to estimate its velocity, position and required driving pressure is essential before pigging. To enhance these predictions, the frictional force between pig and pipeline is a key determinant and insufficient understanding of the frictional force characteristics leads to significant inaccuracies. As the frictional force acting parallel to the pipeline wall plane is a function of contact force in the radial direction, a 2D axisymmetric nonlinear finite element model was proposed to predict the contact force experienced by bi-directional pig by using ANSYS. The impacts of four parameters (including interference, thickness, chamfer dimension and clamping rate of the sealing discs) on the contact force and the deflection angle of the sealing disc are studied at different differential pressures over the pig. Results obtained in this study shows that the thickness of the sealing disc has the greatest impact on contact force of the bi-directional pig, followed by the chamfer dimension, then the clamping rate and finally the interference. A linear relationship between the contact force and the differential pressure can also be observed from the results. Research findings on the characteristic of contact force and deflection angle of sealing disc may provide useful information for the formulation of theoretical or mathematical models to predict the frictional force on the pig, and pigging risks may be efficiently reduced by establish mitigating strategies on the basis of prediction.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. Sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the l1-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems. Several examples of flow fields resulting from numerical simulations and physical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method. {\~{A}}{\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

This article presents an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for integration problems, including convergence theory, sampling methods and variance reduction techniques. Accelerated convergence for Monte Carlo quadrature is attained using quasi-random (also called low-discrepancy) sequences, which are a deterministic alternative to random or pseudo-random sequences. The points in a quasi-random sequence are correlated to provide greater uniformity. The resulting quadrature method, called quasi-Monte Carlo, has a convergence rate of approximately O((logN)kN−1). For quasi-Monte Carlo, both theoretical error estimates and practical limitations are presented. Although the emphasis in this article is on integration, Monte Carlo simulation of rarefied gas dynamics is also discussed. In the limit of small mean free path (that is, the fluid dynamic limit), Monte Carlo loses its effectiveness because the collisional distance is much less than the fluid dynamic length scale. Computational examples are presented throughout the text to illustrate the theory. A number of open problems are described.},

The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic time- domain simulation of the inflow turbulence and of the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed, both for the turbine and for the input wind/wave conditions. While for the wind, inflow turbu- lence models are fairly well established due to the relative maturity of the industry for onshore wind energy development, for wave input, the current practice is to model irreg- ular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. These wave modeling assumptions do not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to these less realistic (albeit simple) representations of ocean waves, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on the support structure (monopile) of an offshore wind turbine. We use a 5MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, the sim- pler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify controlling environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are asso- ciated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We then present the theory for an improved nonlinear second-order irregular wave modeling approach which we use to compute hydrodynamic loads on a stand-alone monopile analyzed quasi-statically for the controlling long-term design environmental con- ditions identified from the linear model. We demonstrate that computed hydrodynamic loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines. This motivates the need for continuing work directed towards incorporation of nonlinear irregular wave models in turbine response simulation studies and loads extrapolation for design.},

The effects of the geometrical parameters and location of the wavy pipe on its performance of slug mitigation and flow characteristics in pipeline/wavy-pipe/riser systems were examined through the CFD models. With the increase of the amplitude or length of the wavy pipe, the slug in the pipeline/riser system becomes shorter.

However, for a pipe in a hilly terrain or in an offshore pipeline-riser system, a steady state operation is often not possible, and conditions of severe or terrain slugging develop. This causes the system to operate in an undesired cyclic fashion in which alternate long liquid slugs are followed by the production of high gas flow rate. The present work deals with the condition under which steady state operation is possible. It shows theoretically that it is possible to stablize the flow by increasing the back pressure of the separator or by employing a controlled choking at the pipe exit. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Recent results on the bifurcation of various types of capillary-gravity waves, including two-dimensional solitary waves at the minimum of the dispersion curve, are reviewed. A survey of various mechanisms (including the most recent ones) to explain the frequency downshift phenomenon is provided. Recent significant results are given on “horseshoe” patterns, which are three-dimensional structures observable on the sea surface under the action of wind or in wave tank experiments. The so-called short-crested waves are then discussed. Finally, the importance of surface tension effects on steep waves is studied.},

abstract = {Linear stability of horizontal gas-liquid stratified flow was solved using a tau spectral method that is valid for all wavenumbers. Pressures of 0.1-10 atm and liquid viscosities of 1-600 cP were examined. Comparison of these results with Kelvin-Helmholtz, integral momentum and rigorous long wave expansion approaches indicates that the approximate models do not correctly predict the point of neutral stability. The discrepancies in the models are due to more than differences in the calculation of interfacial perturbation stress components and differences in the base states. Stability predictions that include gas phase turbulence, as modeled with either a polynomial velocity profile or with imposed boundary conditions obtained from measured pressure and shear stress variations, are similar to laminar results if the interfacial stress and liquid depth are the same. The long wave stability boundary is found to correlate well for different channel height, density ratio and viscosity ratio, using a gas superficial Froude number corrected with a square root of density ratio and a liquid superficial Froude number. For gas-liquid channel flow waves that grow fastest typically have dimensionless wavenumbers of order unity. Their growth rate scales as a corrected gas Reynolds number to the first power. If the gas-liquid depth ratio is less than approximately one, long waves can be unstable before moderate wavelength waves. Under conditions where unstable moderate wavelength waves appear within a couple of meters, it can take 20-50 times this length for slowly growing long wavelength waves, which can destroy regime stability, to appear. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

With simplifications, such as massless gas phase and no wall and interfacial frictions, analytical solutions had been previously obtained for the transient liquid velocity and void fraction distribution. The water faucet problem and its analytical solutions have been widely used for code assessment, benchmark, and numerical verification. In this work, we present a new set of analytical solutions to the water faucet problem at the steady-state condition, with the gas-phase density's effect on pressure distribution considered. This new set of analytical solutions is used in a rigorous numerical verification process from which the anticipated second-order spatial accuracy is achieved for a second-order spatial discretization scheme. On the contrary, the same anticipated order of accuracy could not be obtained using the Ransom solutions as the reference. In addition, extended Ransom transient solutions for the gas-phase velocity and pressure are derived with the assumption of decoupled liquid and gas pressures. Numerical benchmark on the extended Ransom solutions is also presented.},

abstract = {To study wind farm aerodynamics (WFA), the Wind Power industry currently relies on simple Engineering Models (EM) that simulate wind farms using basic principles of physics and empirically established approximations. EMs are fast and accurate for an overview of WFA and gauging mean power production, but cannot resolve phenomena like wake meandering, effect of atmospheric stratification on wake development, a turbine's response to partial wake interaction and yawed inflows etc., and their relation with turbine loading, which require a first principle physics-based model, namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although advances in computer technology have promoted the application of CFD, the study of WFA is yet unworkable with Direct Numerical Simulation, which is the most comprehensive CFD technique. Thus, as a trade-off between cost and detail, researchers must resort to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to garner thorough knowledge of WFA, which could in succession help the industry improve engineering models. This paper summarises the contributions of various LES investigations into WFA and how they have helped broaden our understanding of the subject. Additionally, the article touches upon the optimal use of LES and of the resultant data, and also the challenges faced by LES.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine preservice elementary school teachers' geometry learning as investigated by both qualitative and quantitative methods. For the qualitative investigation, narrative analysis and thematic analysis methods were used. The findings of narrative analysis indicated two main kinds of stories: as a learner and as a beginning teacher. The thematic analysis findings yield to three themes: history of learning geometry, perceptions about geometry, effective geometry instructional practices. The findings informed the quantitative investigation on geometry content knowledge for the case of quadrilaterals. During the second phase of the study, 102 participants who enrolled in the methods course completed pre and post test of teachers' geometry content knowledge. Treatment group participants (n=54) received series of activities (geometry activities and student work analysis) focusing on quadrilaterals, and control group participants (n=48) received traditional instruction. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed a significant change in treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge. The mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of knowledge but no significant interaction between geometry content knowledge and grouping. Even though treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge growth was significant, the difference between treatment group and control group participants' growth in geometry content knowledge was not significant. This study informs mathematics teacher education in three important areas; limited knowledge of preservice teachers' geometry content knowledge, integrating mathematics content and the context of teaching into methods course, and use of student work with preservice teachers.},

abstract = {The distribution of most chemical species in a porous environment is generally determined by both transport and biogeochemical processes. When a system in equilibrium is disturbed by the addition of species, the system reacts in a complex way to approach a new equilibrium. The time scale of that adjustment depends on the kinetics of slow reactions. Such a representation is given in many experiments or technical devices. In a natural environment, surface water penetrates into adjacent sediments and may reach pumping wells for drinking water after a subsurface passage in a porous medium. Downstream from landfills, contaminated sites, and mine tailings is particularly crucial as toxic or otherwise harmful substances contribute to the pool of chemical species. In order to obtain an understanding of the complex interaction of different processes involved, computer simulations are tools without alternative. In modeling studies, the simultaneous action of transport and biogeochemistry is to be considered. Codes, which perform such computations, are implemented following different numerical and conceptual methods, of which most important ones are outlined in the chapter Several example cases, some hypothetical, some with practical relation including carbonate chemistry are presented, discussed, and modeled in the chapter. Simulations are performed with a self-developed MATLAB module. The popular operator splitting (two-step) approach is to be handled with care. It may produce severe errors for increasing kinetic rate constants, for which the direct approach produces reliable results.},

In this paper we present several partitioned procedures for time-integrating this focus coupled problem and discuss their merits in terms of accuracy, stability, heterogeneous computing, I/O transfers, subcycling and parallel processing. All theoretical results are derived for a one-dimensional piston model problem with a compressible flow, because the complete three-dimensional aeroelastic problem is difficult to analyze mathematically. However, the insight gained from the analysis of the coupled piston problem and the conclusions drawn from its numerical investigation are confirmed with the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional transient aeroelastic response of a flexible panel in a transonic non-linear Euler flow regime. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {A new approach to chemistry modeling for large eddy simulation of turbulent react- ing flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modeling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Presently, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent-of-reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which de- scribe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast chemistry and steady flamelet models for predicting ve- locity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fueled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data and sig- nificantly outperform the fast chemistry and steady flamelet models, which both predict an attached flame. –},

@article{Rozema2015a,
abstract = {Minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are a class of sub-filter models for large-eddy simulation that give the minimum eddy dissipation required to dissipate the energy of sub-filter scales. A previously derived minimum-dissipation model is the QR model. This model is based on the invariants of the resolved rate-of-strain tensor and has many desirable properties. It appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flows, has low computational complexity, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on isotropic grids. However, the QR model proposed in the literature gives insufficient eddy dissipation. It is demonstrated that this can be corrected by increasing the model constant. The corrected QR model gives good results in simu- lations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid. On anisotropic grids the QR model is not consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor and requires an approximation of the filter width. It is demonstrated that the results of the QR model on anisotropic grids are primarily determined by the used filter width approximation, and that no approximation gives satisfactory results in simulations of both a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. A new minimum-dissipation model for anisotropic grids is proposed. This anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model generalizes the desirable practical and theoretical properties of the QR model to anisotropic grids and does not require an approximation of the filter width. TheAMDmodel is success- fully applied in simulations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid and in simulations of a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow on anisotropic grids.},

Different from previous approaches that were formulated in spectral space, the proposed method is developed in a physical-space representation and allows for determining numerical dissipation rates and viscosities locally, that is, at the individual cell level, or for arbitrary subdomains of the computational domain. The method is self-contained and uses only the results produced by the Navier-Stokes solver being investigated. As no further information is required, it is suitable for a straightforward quantification of numerical dissipation as a post-processing step. We demonstrate the method's capabilities on the example of implicit large-eddy simulations of a three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex flow, serving as a test flow going through laminar, transitional, and turbulent stages of time evolution. For validation, we compare results for the effective numerical dissipation rate with exact reference data we obtained with an accurate, spectral-space approach.},

The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a "nearby" problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.},

The target design vessel was chosen as 230 K LNG-FPSO with tow-row tank arrangement and the reference vessel as 138 K conventional LNG carrier, which has past track record without any significant failure due to sloshing loads. Starting with the site-specific metocean data, ship motion analysis was carried out with 3D diffraction-radiation program, then the obtained ship motion data was used as 6DOF tank excitation for subsequent sloshing model test and analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out with obtained peak data and the long-term sloshing load was determined out of it. It was concluded that the normalized sloshing impact pressure on 230 K LNG-FPSO with two-row tank arrangement is higher than that of convectional LNG carrier, hence requires the use of reinforced cargo containment system for the sake of failure-free operation without filling limitation.},

The new VLES model is developed in this paper to overcome some of the apparent deficiencies of RANS and LES. The CLSVOF method, which combined the LS and VOF methods, was proposed by Sussman and Puckett. Two filling levels, 18.3{\%} and 43.7{\%}, are considered in the present analysis. Some complicated sloshing phenomena, including the plunging wave breaking, wave impact on the sidewall and the roof and the beating phenomenon can be observed in the present sloshing cases. The computational velocity fields, wave profiles and pressure data are compared with experimental results from Delorme and Souto???Iglesias. It must be emphasized that the analysis of the velocity amplitude and the free surface evolution are mainly focused on non-breaking wave and violent breaking wave, respectively. The specific objectives are: to evaluate the performance of the CLSVOF method and VLES model for modelling of liquid sloshing; (ii) to investigate the influence of interface capturing method and turbulence model on sloshing simulation results. This study will demonstrate that, contrary to the commonly held view, turbulence modelling and free surface tracking in violent and non???violent sloshing simulation play a dominant role and a secondary role, respectively.},

abstract = {The violent motion (sloshing) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in cargo tanks has attracted significant attention. Transformations of the LNG market have led to the increased transport of LNG in partially filled tanks, but established technology is mainly based on engineering experience with completely filled containers. This paper investigates a large sample of sloshing pressure measurements. It focuses on the magnitude of individual sloshing impact events, and their associated temporal and spatial patterns. The durations of these impacts are comparable to the natural frequency of an LNG container wall, so the details of their time histories are important in determining the structural response. Experiments are performed on tanks with high (92.5{\%}) and low (30{\%}) filling levels, for various wave headings. The common post-processing approach of representing impact pressure histories by a triangular profile is studied, and an alternative approach is presented. Two statistical models are used to describe the distribution of maximal pressures in sloshing impacts: a three-parameter Weibull model and a generalized Pareto model. The latter is found to be of questionable utility due to small sample sizes. It is observed that for low filling levels the sloshing impacts are of greater magnitude, having longer durations, smaller ratios of rise time to duration, and larger spatial extents. All these factors should in principle increase the structural response. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This thesis analyses models for twophase flows and methods for the numerical resolution of these models. It is therefore one contribution to the development of reliable design tools for multiphase applications. Such tools are needed and expected by engineers in a range of fields, including in the oil and gas industry. The approximate Riemann solver of Roe has been studied. Roe schemes for three different twophase flow models have been implemented in the framework of a standard numerical algorithm for the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. The schemes have been analysed by calculation of benchmark tests from the literature, and by comparison with each other. A Roe scheme for the has been implemented, and a secondorder extension based on wave decomposition and fluxdifference splitting was shown to work well and to give improved results compared to the firstorder scheme. The convergence properties of the scheme were tested on smooth and discontinuous solutions. A Roe scheme has been proposed for pressure relaxation. The use of analogous numerical methods for the fiveequation and fourequation models allowed for a direct comparison of a method with and without pressure relaxation. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the two approaches converged to the same results, but that the was significantly more dissipative, particularly for contact discontinuities. Furthermore, even though the fiveequation model with instantaneous pressure relaxation has real eigenvalues, the calculations showed that it produced oscillations for cases where the fourequation model had complex eigenvalues. A Roe scheme has been constructed for the driftflux model with general closure laws. For the case of the Zuber-Findlay slip law describing bubbly flows, the Roe matrix is completely analytical. Hence the present Roe scheme is more efficient than previous fully numerical Roe schemes for the driftflux model. An isentropic has been presented. The incorporation of different interfacialpressure models was discussed, and examples were given. With the adequate models for the interfacial pressure and velocity, the agreement was very good between the discreteequation model and the fiveequation Roe scheme. The fluxlimiter centred (flic) scheme was tested for the the firstorder version (force) of the scheme was found to work well, but it was rather diffusive. The purpose of the multistage (musta) method is to come close to the accuracy of upwind schemes while retaining the simplicity of centred schemes. Here it has been applied to the driftflux model. As the number of stages was increased, the results of the musta scheme approached those of the Roe method. The good results of the musta scheme were dependent on the use of a largeenough local grid. Hence, the main advantage of the musta scheme is its simplicity. A multiphase has been tested, and it was shown to be workable for transient problems.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of negative frictional pressure drop could occur in vertical two-phase flow in some conditions. At gas-liquid ratios ranging from 100 to 10,000, the two-phase flow in a liquid-loading gas well was experimentally simulated in a vertical pipe. The superficial gas velocities range from 0.1. m/s to 20. m/s and the superficial liquid velocities range from 0.00001. m/s to 0.2. m/s corresponding to the gas-liquid ratios. The negative frictional pressure drop was observed in this experiment. The uncertainty analysis shows that the negative frictional pressure drop could not be undoubtedly attributed to measurement error. Further investigation indicates that the energy loss is associated with a buoyancy-like term in addition to the frictional pressure drop in vertical two-phase flow. By taking this buoyancy-like term into account, the energy losses obtained from experimental data are all positive in the cases of negative frictional pressure drops. The results demonstrate the potential for the negative frictional pressure drop in which case the energy loss is positive and hence the rule of energy conversion is not violated in vertical two-phase flow. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A numerical study based on a one-dimensional two-fluid model is carried out to describe the transient hydrodynamic slugging and terrain-induced severe slugging in a pipeline-riser system. The system of equations is rendered well-posed by interfacial pressure model for the riser. The selected flow conditions are restricted in the well-posed region for the horizontal and the downward inclined pipes to ensure the hydrodynamic slug characteristics are predicted correctly. The validity of the model is examined by water faucet problem and horizontal slug flow experiments. Simulations with and without slug capturing are conducted to address the effect of hydrodynamic slugs on severe slugging. It has been found that more accurate predictions are obtained by taking hydrodynamic slugs into account. At low superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to overestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream gas expansion is suppressed by the hydrodynamic slugs. At relatively high superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to underestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream compressible volume is greatly enlarged by the blowout of the hydrodynamic slugs. In both situations, the influences of the hydrodynamic slugs can reduce the errors of the predicted severe slugging characteristics.},

abstract = {For nuclear reactor safety analysis, the one-dimensional two-fluid model equations are solved numerically with the first order upwind method because of its robust stability. In the present two-fluid model for horizontal stratified flow, surface tension is included because it makes the model well-posed. However, this is not done in industrial applications and numerical viscosity provides linear stabilization even when the model is ill-posed. It is now shown that numerical viscosity also provides nonlinear stabilization; meaning that the wave growth is bounded when the flow is unstable (e.g., in case of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability). The formation of kinematic shocks in the presence of numerical viscosity provides the dissipation mechanism needed to stop the wave growth. However, numerical viscosity varies with the mesh size, which means that even though the unstable model is well-posed and meets von Neumann and nonlinear stabilization requirements, the solution does not converge for some short wavelengths greater than 2??x. Furthermore, when the mesh size is large, significant artificial viscosity is added to the continuity and momentum equations and the model may become over-stabilized. A more scientific approach is proposed: to add a physical dissipation mechanism instead of numerical viscosity, i.e., Reynolds stresses. This approach has two advantages: first, the one-dimensional two-fluid model converges under severe dynamic conditions, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and second, a higher order numerical method may be used instead of the first order upwind scheme without experiencing numerical excursions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Asphaltene deposition has been repeatedly reported in various oil fields with interest on how it impacts the development of a reservoir. In many of the reported cases, it has been indicated that asphaltene deposition damages the wellbore and production facilities more severely than the formation. A great deal of research has been conducted to study the phase behavior and dynamic aspect of asphaltene deposition. However, there is a lack of comprehensive integrated modeling of asphaltene deposition in the wellbore during the multiphase fluid flow. In this paper, we present an implementation of asphaltene precipitation and deposition models into a thermal, multiphase, multi-component wellbore simulator that can be coupled with a compositional reservoir simulator. A key contribution of this work is the development of a simulator for predicting the detrimental effects of asphaltene in a well. Simulation results can show where and when the presence of asphaltene particles severely damages the efficiency and the productivity of the wells. This prediction is highly crucial if it is aimed to control the well performance and to optimize productivity.},

abstract = {Long liquid slugs, with sizes reaching 500 pipe diameters or more, may form in gas-liquid horizontal pipe flow at intermediate liquid loadings. Such slugs cause serious operational upsets due to the strong fluctuations in flow supply and pressure. Therefore, predicting the transition from short (hydrodynamic) to long slug flow regimes may play a significant role in preventing or reducing the negative effects caused by the long slugs. In this paper we introduce a growth model for calculating the average slug length in horizontal and near horizontal pipes. The model applies a volumetric balance between the front and tail of the slug in order to calculate the slug growth rate. The dynamic behaviour of the liquid at the tail is described by a linear kinematic relation between the slug downstream and the wave upstream. For the validation of the model we performed measurements in a 137 m length air-water horizontal pipe flow of an internal diameter (i.d.) of 0.052 m. The measurements provide a detailed flow map of the long slug regime and sub-regimes. Furthermore, we compared predictions by the model with available data for a range of 0.019-0.095 m i.d. pipes to investigate the effect of varying operation pressures, different inlet conditions, different fluid properties and slight inclinations. The model predicted the transitions from hydrodynamic to long slugs with satisfactory agreements, however it underpredicts the average slug length at relatively large mixture velocities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The code models the coupled behavior of the reactor coolant system and the core for loss-of-coolant accidents and operational transients such as anticipated transient without scram, loss of offsite power, loss of feedwater, and loss of flow. A generic modeling approach is used that permits simulating a variety of thermal hydraulic systems. Control system and secondary system components are included to permit modeling of plant controls, turbines, condensers, and secondary feedwater systems. RELAP5/MOD3.3 code documentation is divided into seven volumes: Volume 1 presents modeling theory and associated numerical schemes; Volume 2 details instructions for code application and input data preparation; Volume 3 presents the results of developmental assessment cases that demonstrate and verify the models used in the code; Volume 4 discusses in detail RELAP5 models and correlations; Volume 5 presents guidelines that have evolved over the past several years through the use of the RELAP5 code; Volume 6 discusses the numerical scheme used in RELAP5; Volume 7 presents a collection of independent assessment calculations; and Volume 8 contains information of interest to RELAP5 programmers.},

abstract = {The statistical distribution of slug lengths in a gas-liquid pipeline evolves along the pipe as short slugs collapse. This results from a lack of development of the liquid velocity profile at the rear of each slug that is shorter than a minimum stable length. Experiments have been conducted in a 50 mm diameter tube inclined at +5??to the horizontal to determine the rate of collapse of short slugs as a function of their length. The data covers both stagnant and turbulent flowing liquid, in both the elongated bubble and slug flow regimes. The data shows that all the turbulent flow results may be correlated by the same expression regardless of the value of the slug liquid Reynolds number. This correlation is employed within a model adapted for horizontal flow that assumes a random distribution of slug lengths at the pipe entrance and calculates the evolution of the slug length distribution along a pipe. The results of the model are compared against experimentally determined slug length distributions obtained in a 16 m long pipe. The comparison between the calculated and observed average slug length is shown to be quite good over a range of flow rates and the overall shape of the length distributions is predicted well by the model.

abstract = {Two-phase flow occurs during the production of oil and gas in the wellbores. Modeling this phenomenon is important for monitoring well productivity and designing surface facilities. Since transient time period in the producing well is usually shorter than reservoir time steps, stabilized flow is assumed in the wellbore. As such, semi-steady state models are used for modeling wellbore dynamics. However, in the case that flow variations occur in a short period of time (i.e., gas kick during drilling) the use of a transient two-phase model is crucial. A great deal of research has been conducted to study transient two-phase flow in wellbores. However, there is lack of a comprehensive two-fluid model in the petroleum literature. In this paper, we present an implementation of a pseudocompositional, thermal, fully implicit, transient two-fluid model for two-phase flow in wellbores. In this model, we solve gas/liquid mass balance, gas/liquid momentum balance, and two-phase energy balance equations to obtain five primary variables: liquid velocity, gas velocity, pressure, holdup, and temperature. This simulator can be used as a stand-alone code or can be used in conjunction with a reservoir simulator to mimic wellbore/reservoir dynamic interactions. In our model, we consider stratified, bubbly, intermittent and annular flow regimes using appropriate closure relations for inter-phase and wall shear stress terms in the momentum equations. In our simulation, we found that the inter-phase and wall shear stress terms for different flow regimes can significantly affect the model's results. In addition, the inter-phase momentum transfer terms mainly influence the holdup value. The outcome of this research leads to a more accurate simulation of multiphase flow in the wellbore and pipes, which can be applied to the surface facility design, well performance optimization, and wellbore damage estimation.},

abstract = {The upstream offshore multi-phase well-pipeline-riser installations are facing huge challenges related to slugging flow: An unstable flow regime where the flow rates, pressures and temperatures oscillate in the multi-phase pipelines. One typical severe slug is induced by vertical wells or risers causing the pressure to build up and hence originates the oscillating pressure and flow. There exist many negative consequences related to the severe slugging flow and thus lots of investments and effort have been put into reducing or completely eliminating the severe slug. This paper reviews in details the state-of-the-art related to analysis, detection, dynamical modeling and elimination of the slug within the offshore oil {\&} gas Exploration and Production (E{\&}P) processes. Modeling of slugging flow has been used to investigate the slug characteristics and for design of anti-slug control as well, however most models require specific facility and operating data which, unfortunately, often is not available from most offshore installations. Anti-slug control have been investigated for several decades in oil {\&} gas industry, but many of these existing methods suffer the consequent risk of simultaneously reducing the oil {\&} gas production. This paper concludes that slug is a well defined phenomenon, but even though it has been investigated for several decades the current anti-slug control methods still have problems related to robustness. It is predicted that slug-induced challenges will be even more severe as a consequence of the longer vertical risers caused by deep-water E{\&}P in the future.},

abstract = {Prediction of the liquid level in stratified two-phase upwards flow shows that one may have multiple solutions. In this case it is necessary to determine which solutions will actually occur and whether hysteresis is possible, namely whether it is possible to have two or more solutions for the same operating conditions. In this work the stability of the solutions for stratified flow is considered using two types of stability analyses: (1) structural stability analysis; and (2) interfacial stability analysis (Kelvin-Helmholtz, K-H). For the K-H stability analysis we used two methods: an approximate simplified method suggested by Taitel {\&} Dukler; and a more rigorous method suggested by Barnea, which is based on a combination of the viscous K-H and inviscid K-H analyses. The results show that whenever three solutions exist only the first, i.e. the solution with the thinnest liquid level, is stable. The middle solution is always structurally unstable (linearly), whereas the third solution is structurally unstable to large disturbances (non-linear stability). The third solution is usually also unstable to the K-H type of instability. As a result it is concluded that hysteresis is not possible and that only the thinnest solution will be observed practically. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The experiments were conducted using a horizontal 31. m long, D=10. cm internal diameter transparent pipe at atmospheric pressure. High resolution photography allowed the location of the gas-liquid interface to be measured with a high degree of accuracy at 5. Hz. Image analysis allowed individual waves to be tracked over a 14. D section of the pipe. Regular waves having similar properties such as speed, amplitude and length were seen far from the region of slug formation. However, near the transition region, where hydrodynamic slugs were formed, significant differences between wave properties were observed which resulted in wave interaction leading to a type of sub-harmonic resonance and slug formation. The formation of hydrodynamic slugs due to wave interaction differs from predictions for slug formation using long wavelength stability theory. The properties of the waves were quantified which gave detailed information on the resonance mechanism found near the transition to slugging. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A drift-flux model, evaluated for the local conditions in the riser, is used as a closure law. The developed model predicts the location of the liquid accumulation front in the pipeline and the liquid level in the riser, so it is possible to determine which type of severe slugging occurs in the system.

We demonstrate that the closure is able to give a good prediction of displacement front velocities in the viscous regime, comparing well with experimental values, and can be used for approximating other design features of a displacement process, e.g. the maximal static wall layer (in the case of a yield stress fluid) and the minimal flow rate to prevent backflow. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Al-Safran2009a,
abstract = {The objective of this study is to phenomenologically investigate the parameters controlling slug frequency in horizontal two-phase pipe flow and to develop a predictive empirical correlation. In this study, two aspects governing slug frequency are investigated, namely the slug initiation mechanism at the pipe entrance region (entrance effect) and the flow development along the pipe (pipe length effect). Experimental results show that fully developed slugs generated under the hydrodynamic slugging mechanism have lower frequency than those generated under the terrain slugging mechanism for high Froude number conditions (NFr {\textgreater} 3). Conversely, fully developed slugs generated under the terrain slugging mechanism have frequency greater than those generated under hydrodynamic slugging frequency in low Froude number conditions (NFr {\textless} 3). Although the effect of the flow development along the pipe on slug frequency is a controversial issue in the literature, experimental data show its irrelevance to slug frequency over a wide range of operational conditions. However, experimental results show slug frequency decline along a pipeline in the case of very high liquid flow rate and very low gas flow rate and vice versa. Based on the understanding of the related physical parameters to slug frequency, a new slug frequency correlation is developed using a broad range experimental database. The developed multiple linear correlation accounts for 92{\%} of the variation in the slug frequency in the experimental data. A validation study of the new correlation against an independent data set revealed an average error and standard deviation of 35{\%} and 68{\%}, respectively. A tuned version of the model using the model statistical coefficients' confidence intervals revealed improved validation results of 19{\%} average percent error (outperforming existing correlations) and 62{\%} standard deviation. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider the motion of a deformable interface that separates a fully-developed tur- bulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid.We outline a linear model to describe the interaction between the turbulent gas flow and the interfacial waves. This approach includes two steps. First, we derive a flat-interface base state. This comprises a velocity profile that takes account of the laminar sublayer present in the near-interfacial region of the gas, and a method for determining the wall and interfacial shear stresses as a function of the mean pressure gradient. The second step involves an Orr–Sommerfeld analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and necessitates the selection of a turbulent-stress closure scheme. This approach permits us to determine numeri- cally the growth rate of the wave amplitude, as a function of the relevant dimensionless system parameters and turbulence closure relations. It also extends previous work by accounting for the effects of the thin liquid layer on the dynamics. The inclusion of this feature has a startling effect: by a judicious choice of viscosity or density contrast, or of surface-roughness parameter, we observe mode competition, in which the maximum growth rate of the instability derives its energy from internal effects in the liquid layer, rather than from interfacial effects. We have also classified the observed waves either as ‘fast' or ‘slow', and compared our results with experimental data: excellent agreement is obtained in the slow-wave case, while only qualitative agreement is obtained for faster waves. This is consistent with our demonstration that the stationary turbulence model used is valid only for slow waves.},

With this aim, viscous flow tests in rotational rheometers and pressure drop measurements in pipelines have been carried out using different geometries with both smooth and rough surfaces. The Sisko model has been used to predict the pressure drop gradient. The drag ratio, as a function of air flow rate, for highly viscous pastes such as lubricating greases, significantly differs, qualitative and quantitatively, from that found in the literature for other non-Newtonian fluids with viscosities of around 200 times lower. The pressure drop gradient in the intermittent multiphase flow regime can be predicted by modifying the classical approach of Lockhart and Martinelli with an empirical correction factor. An empirical model, with a combination of power-law and sigmoidal-type equations, has been proposed to describe the experimental evolution of the drag ratio as a function of ReL???/ReTP???. The accuracy of the proposed model has been tested by estimating the classical Fanning friction factor for a non-Newtonian fluid, f = 16/Re???, once the pressure loss has been corrected with the drag ratio previously obtained. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension.

abstract = {ABSTRACT:  A new set of measurements of pressure drops and liquid hold-up taken at TEASistemi Laboratory under conditions of stratified gas-liquid flow has been used to improve the closure relations adopted in MAST, a new transient one-dimensional multiphase flow simulator. These data are relative to water-nitrogen flow in a 3.15 in (80 mm) horizontal pipe operating at pressures in the range 72.5-362.6 psig (5-25 bar). The results obtained allowed a more reliable description of stratified gas-liquid flow in hydrocarbon transportation pipelines. A comparison with the performance of other flow simulators is also presented.    INTRODUCTION  The simulation of gas-liquid flow in pipelines can be based on the solution of 1-D mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, [1]. These equations depend on a set of closure relations, in general of empirical nature. The closures adopted in commercial codes are similar to those proposed in the open literature, on the basis of data taken at atmospheric pressure, in small diameter pipes. These correlations have then been modified on the basis of experimental data taken at conditions which more closely resemble field conditions. Field data are used for the final validation of these codes. Notwithstanding the amount of work performed for code testing and validation, quite often the simulation of real pipelines remains unsatisfactory, the reason probably being that from one hand t},

It is found that the shapes of the nose and body of bubble depend on the Froude number defined by gas/liquid mixture velocity in a pipe, whereas the shape of the back of bubble region depends on both the Froude number and bubble length. The photographic studies show that the transition from plug to slug flow occurs when the back of the bubble changes from staircase pattern to hydraulic jump with the increase of the Froude number and bubble length. The effect of pipe inclination on characteristics of bubble is significant: The bubble is inversely located in a downwardly inclined pipe when the Froude number is low, and the transition from plug flow to slug flow in an upward inclined pipe is more ready to occur compared with that in a downwardly inclined pipe.},

Bubbles of different volumes were studied, their lengths varying from 30 to 100 times the pipe diameter. Two different shapes were observed corresponding to plug and slug flow regimes. The transition between plug and slug flow was shown to depend on both Froude number and bubble length. A model based on the mass and momentum conservation equations of each phase is proposed. It is able to predict the transition between plug and slug flow regimes as well as the volume and the shape of long bubbles. It is shown that usual slug flow codes that aim to predict the void fraction tend to overestimate the gas fraction in the bubble region. The model may be easily implemented into slug tracking codes.},

It is shown that for the considered flow such a transformation requires some additional constraints on the change of the inclination angle and flow rates of each of the phases. While the Squire's theorem (on the two-dimensionality of the critical disturbances) rigorously holds for the horizontal two-phase flow, for the inclined flow an exact mathematical theorem cannot be formulated. Nevertheless, it has been proven that 2D perturbations are the critical ones also for the case of inclined channel, since the transformation of a 3D stability problem to its 2D analog is associated with a stabilizing effect of reducing the system inclination, in addition to the reduction of the phases flow rates as in the case of horizontal flows.},

abstract = {Two-phase flows in pipelines occur in a variety of processes in the nuclear, petroleum and gas industries. Because of the practical importance of accurately predicting steady and unsteady flows along the line, two-fluid models have been extensively used in numerical simulations. These models are usually written as a system of non-linear partial-differential equations. A reliable prediction of such flows is a difficult task to accomplish due to the numerous sources of uncertainties, such as the basic two-phase flow model, the flow-pattern models, the initial and boundary conditions and the numerical method used to solve the initial-boundary-value problem. Several numerical methods, conservative or not, may be used to discretize the problem. In this paper we analyze the global performance of the numerical model, obtained when we couple a classical one-dimensional single-pressure four-equation two-fluid model to a numerical discretization based on the flux-corrected transport (FCT) method, to solve the stratified-pattern two-phase flow that occurs in typical gas-gathering offshore pipelines. The gas phase is considered to be compressible and the liquid phase is incompressible, whereas the flow is assumed to be isothermal. We show that the FCT method is second-order in space and that our numerical kernel produces accurate simulations for steady, as well as unsteady, simulations. We also analyze the hyperbolicity property of the two-fluid model and the adequate prescription of the boundary conditions. The results show that hyperbolicity is lost in part of the area of the stratified-pattern region of a classical flow-pattern diagram. Moreover, the eigenvalues alternate signs at the boundaries, which has implications on how to impose the boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of typical offshore gas pipeline flows show very good agreement when compared to a commercial software.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in some basic investigations of properties of the relaxation schemes first introduced by Jin and Xin [1]. The main advantages of these schemes are that they neither require the use of Riemann solvers nor the computation of nonlinear flux Jacobians. This can be an important advantage when more complex models are considered where it is not possible to perform analytical calculations of Jacobians and/or when considering fluids with nonstandard equation of state. We apply the schemes (relaxing and relaxed) to a certain two-phase model where Jacobians cannot in general be calculated analytically. We first demonstrate that the original relaxation schemes of Jin and Xin produce a poor approximation for a typical mass transport example which involves transition from two-phase flow to single-phase flow. However, by introducing a slight modification of the original relaxation model by splitting the momentum flux into a mass and pressure part, we obtain some flux splitting relaxation schemes which for typical two-phase flow cases yield a more accurate and robust approximation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of the Error-in-Variable Model (EVM), a type of parameter estimation techniques, for the determination of the internal pipe wall surface conditions (effective surface roughness) of pipe segments in complex natural gas pipeline networks and sub-lateral gathering networks. This technique uses SCADA data collected over a period of time such as pressures, temperatures and flow rates at boundary points of the network, i.e. at receipt and delivery points. These data are used as input to the EVM along with pertinent objective functions that are based on dimensional mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The main focus of the technique is to extract reliable and accurate information with regard to the internal wall surface condition of pipe segments within the network that are showing evidence of fouling or under-performing from the flow efficiency perspective. The EVM is most suited for this problem as it accounts for uncertainties in the SCADA data from errors in the measurement instrumentations, the time averaging processing of the data and the inherent assumption of the quasi-steadiness of the flow rates. Insight into the implication of pipe segments arranged in series or in parallel within the network is highlighted. Guidance as to the relationship between the number of necessary distinct data sets required for a given number of parameters (surface roughness of pipe segments) to be estimated and the number of independent objective functions that can be written for a given network is provided. Finally, the EVM technique is demonstrated by an existing sub-lateral natural gas receipt network feeding into a main gas transmission pipeline (DN750), 21.1km upstream of a compressor station.},

abstract = {This paper presents a transient roll-wave simulator based on a one-dimensional incompressible two-fluid model. Using an efficient numerical method and a grid cell length of one pipe diameter, the simulator is able to accurately predict experimental data in the roll-wave regime. Essential to obtaining the stable roll-wave solutions is the use of a modified version of the Biberg friction model. Based on an algebraic eddy viscosity model, the Biberg model yields mechanistic expressions for the wall and interfacial shear stresses in stratified two-phase flow. Input to the model is closure relations for the turbulence levels at either side of the interface. In order to model the increased dissipation of energy in breaking wave fronts, we propose to modify the original closures by adding a term proportional to the negative gradient of the liquid height. As the waves grow and come close to breaking, this term redistributes the shear stresses such that the waves are stabilized. The numerical method used in the simulator is an extension of a previously presented pseudospectral Fourier method. In particular, spectral vanishing viscosity terms are introduced to stabilize short wavelengths inconsistent with the long wavelength approximation of the two-fluid model. The result is a simulator that provides reliable and convergent numerical solutions for all stratified flow conditions. In the last part of the paper, the simulator is tested against roll-wave experiments with horizontal and upward inclined flows of water and a dense gas in a 10 cm pipe. Wave heights and speeds as well as mean pressure drops and holdups are predicted within 20{\%} accuracy when compared with 474 experiments. Furthermore, the transient simulations enable us to study the dynamics and interactions between waves. In agreement with experimental observations, two different wave growth mechanisms are identified, and their influence on the evolution of the roll-wave flow regime is analyzed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve the equations efficiently and accurately, we employ Chorin's projection method for the modified Navier-Stokes equations, and the recently developed practically unconditionally stable method for the multi-component Cahn-Hilliard equations. We numerically investigate the effects of various density ratios, tilt angles, Reynolds numbers, and Weber numbers on the interface structures and front velocities.

Pigging flow lines is employed for many reasons including cleaning deposits such as wax layers, the removal of liquids and condensate, the separation of products pumped one after the other in the same pipeline, measurement, and control and flow line inspection. In this paper, the mathematical modeling of the transient motion of a pig through liquid and gas pipelines is presented. For this purpose, the fluid flow equations were combined with a linear momentum equation for the pig. The nonlinear equations are solved under an unsteady state condition by the method of characteristics (MOC) with a regular rectangular grid through the pipeline under appropriate initial and boundary conditions. From this simulation, the pig position, optimum flow rate in upstream flow and the time that the pig reaches the end of the pipeline are obtained. Comparison of the simulation results with the field data of liquid flow through the pipeline from KG to AG located in Iran show that the derived mathematical models are effective for the prediction of position and pig velocity under the given operational conditions of a pipeline.

Lab-scale experiments were conducted to identify the critical conditions required for the onset of water displacement by oil flow from a low horizontal section into an upward inclined section of the pipeline. Two test loops with pipe diameters of 27. mm and 41. mm I.D. with diesel flow were used. Water withdrawal from tapping valves distributed along the up-hill section enabled to follow the water displacement for oil flow rates exceeding the critical value.A model for predicting the water displacement by the oil flow, which is based on the formation of a water plug in the lowest (horizontal) section, is suggested. The predicted amounts of water withdrawn from the tapping valves favorably compare with the experimental results. Considering other competing mechanisms, up-scaling to larger pipe diameters is examined. The analysis indicates that water plug formation appears to be the controlling mechanism for water displacement also in larger pipe diameters encountered in field operations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Part I describes measurements of the shape and rate of rise of air bubbles varying in volume from 1{\textperiodcentered} 5 to 200 cm.3 when they rise through nitrobenzene or water. Measurements of photographs of bubbles formed in nitrobenzene show that the greater part of the upper surface is always spherical. A theoretical discussion, based on the assumption that the pressure over the front of the bubble is the same as that in ideal hydrodynamic flow round a sphere, shows that the velocity of rise, U, should be related to the radius of curvature, R, in the region of the vertex, by the equation U = 2/3√ (gR); the agreement between this relationship and the experimental results is excellent. For geometrically similar bubbles of such large diameter that the drag coefficient would be independent of Reynolds's number, it would be expected that U would be proportional to the sixth root of the volume, V; measurements of eighty-eight bubbles show considerable scatter in the values of U/V1/6, although there is no systematic variation in the value of this ratio with the volume. Part II. Though the characteristics of a large bubble are associated with the observed fact that the hydrodynamic pressure on the front of a spherical cap moving through a fluid is nearly the same as that on a complete sphere, the mechanics of a rising bubble cannot be completely understood till the observed pressure distribution on a spherical cap is understood. Failing this, the case of a large bubble running up a circular tube filled with water and emptying at the bottom is capable of being analyzed completely because the bubble is not then followed by a wake. An approximate calculation shows that the velocity U of rise is U = 0{\textperiodcentered} 46 √ (ga), where a is the radius of the tube. Experiments with a tube 7{\textperiodcentered} 9 cm. diameter gave values of U from 29{\textperiodcentered} 1 to 30{\textperiodcentered} 6 cm./sec., corresponding with values of U/√ (ga) from 0{\textperiodcentered} 466 to 0{\textperiodcentered} 490.},

abstract = {We present results from a study of buoyant miscible displacements flows at moderate viscosity ratios in near-horizontal ducts. Low Atwood numbers are considered. Inertial effects are significant although the flow regimes are laminar. Pipe and plane channel geometries are considered using a mix of experimental, computational and analytical techniques. The main focus of the study is on the effects of the viscosity ratio between the fluids. We show that small viscosity ratios lead to more efficient displacements, as is intuitive. In each geometry we find a mix of viscous and inertial flows, in broadly the same pattern as for the iso-viscous displacements studied extensively in Taghavi et al. (submitted for publication). Predictive models are proposed for the viscous regime, in the case of the plane channel, and for the inertial exchange flow regime, in both geometries. We also study displacement flows with shear-thinning fluids, over a more restrictive range of parameters. We show that with an appropriate definition of the effective viscosity the scaled front velocities fit well with the results from the Newtonian displacements, in both pipe and plane channel geometries. The main role of ratio m of displaced fluid viscosity to displacing viscosity is in line with our intuition. For m{\textgreater}. 1 displacement efficiencies are reduced and the front velocities are larger. However, the main increase in front velocity is achieved for modest viscosity ratios of 3 or 4 to 1, with little increase afterwards. The reverse situation, m{\textless}. 1, shows significant improvements in displacement efficiency, with front velocity V{\^{}} f reduced down towards the imposed mean velocity V{\^{}} 0, as m decreases. A viscosity ratio of around 1-4 appears to achieve quite efficient displacements, and to be able to compensate for the effects of buoyancy (which in our case are always destabilising). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To provide an efficient tool to assist in the control and design of pig operations through pipelines, a numerical code has been developed, based on a finite difference scheme. It allows the simulation of two-fluid transient flow, i.e. liquid-liquid, gas-gas or liquid-gas products in the pipeline. Modules to automatically control process variables were included to employ different strategies to reach an efficient operation. Different test cases were investigated to confirm the robustness of the method. The results obtained with the code were compared with a real oil displacement operation of a section of the OSPAR pipeline, with 762??mm diameter and 60??km length, owned by Petrobras; there was good agreement between the two, thereby validating the method. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamic analysis and simulation of long pig through the two-dimensional gas pipelines. In the modeling, the pig's length is noticed. The long pig is considered as a chain body not a particle. Pig is divided into a number of elements, Newton's second law is written for all the different elements of pig and then all the equations are added to get the dynamic equation of the pig's motion. An algorithm is used to solve the differential equation of the motion based on Runge-Kutta method. Continuity, momentum and the state equations are employed to achieve the gas flow parameters like density, velocity and pressure along the pipeline since the dynamic behavior of the pig depends on the flow field characteristics. It is assumed that pig is long and there is a bypass valve in pig's body. The path of the pig or geometry of the pipeline is considered as 2D curve. Numerical examples are chosen to show the application of the proposed formulation and algorithm. The simulation results illustrate the validity and efficiency of the derived equations for online estimating of the position and velocity of the long pig in gas pipelines at any time of the motion.},

abstract = {Preface to the Second Edition The basic structure of the first edition has been preserved in the second because it remains congruent with the goal of writing “a book that would be a useful modern treatment of a broad range of topics...[that] may be used as an undergraduate or graduate text and as a self-contained reference for a variety of audiences.” The quotation is from the Preface to the First Edition, whose declaration of goals for thework remains unchanged. What is different in the second edition? The core role of canonical forms has been expanded as a unifying element in understanding similarity (complex, real, and simultaneous), unitary equivalence, uni- tary similarity, congruence, *congruence, unitary congruence, triangular equivalence, and other equivalence relations. More attention is paid to cases of equality in the many inequalities considered in the book. Block matrices are a ubiquitous feature of the exposition in the new edition. Learning mathematics has never been a spectator sport, so the newedition continues to emphasize the value of exercises and problems for the active reader. Numerous 2-by-2 examples illustrate concepts throughout the book. Problem threads (some span several chapters) develop special topics as the foundation for them evolves in the text. For example, there are threads involving the adjugate matrix, the compound matrix, finite-dimensional quantum systems, the Loewner ellipsoid and the Loewner–John matrix, and normalizable matrices; see the index for page references for these threads. The first edition had about 690 problems; the second edition has more than 1,100. Many problems have hints; they may be found in an appendix that appears just before the index. A comprehensive index is essential for a book that is intended for sustained use as a reference after initial use as a text. The index to the first edition had about 1,200 entries; the current index has more than 3,500 entries. An unfamiliar term encountered in the text should be looked up in the index, where a pointer to a definition (in Chapter 0 or elsewhere) is likely to be found. New discoveries since 1985 have shaped the presentation of many topics and have stimulated inclusion of some new ones. A few examples of the latter are the Jordan canonical form of a rank-one perturbation, motivated by enduring student interest in the Google matrix; a generalization of real normal matrices (normal matrices A such that A ¯ A is real); computable block matrix criteria for simultaneous unitary similarity or simultaneous unitary congruence; G. Belitskii's discovery that a matrix commutes with a Weyr canonical form if and only if it is block upper triangular and has a special structure; the discovery by K. C. O'Meara and C. Vinsonhaler that, unlike the corresponding situation for the Jordan canonical form, a commuting family can be simultaneously upper triangularized by similarity in such a way that any one specified matrix in the family is in Weyr canonical form; and canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence. Queries from many readers have motivated changes in the way that some topics are presented. For example, discussion of Lidskii's eigenvalue majorization inequalities was moved from a section primarily devoted to singular value inequalities to the section where majorization is discussed. Fortunately, a splendid new proof of Lidskii's inequalities by C. K. Li and R. Mathias became available and was perfectly aligned with Chapter 4's new approach to eigenvalue inequalities for Hermitian matrices. A second example is a new proof of Birkhoff's theorem, which has a very different flavor from the proof in the first edition. Instructors accustomed to the order of topics in the first edition may be interested in a chapter-by-chapter summary of what is different in the new edition: 0. Chapter 0 has been expanded by about 75{\%} to include a more comprehensive summary of useful concepts and facts. It is intended to serve as an as-needed reference. Definitions of terms and notations used throughout the book can be found here, but it has no exercises or problems. Formal courses and reading for self-study typically begin with Chapter 1. 1. Chapter 1 contains new examples related to similarity and the characteristic poly- nomial, as well as an enhanced emphasis on the role of left eigenvectors in matrix analysis. 2. Chapter 2 contains a detailed presentation of real orthogonal similarity, an exposition of McCoy's theorem on simultaneous triangularization, and a rigor- ous treatment of continuity of eigenvalues that makes essential use of both the unitary and triangular aspects of Schur's unitary triangularization theorem. Sec- tion 2.4 (Consequences of Schur's triangularization theorem) is almost twice the length of the corresponding section in the first edition. There are two newsections, one devoted to the singular value decomposition and one devoted to the CS de- composition. Early introduction of the singular value decomposition permits this essential tool of matrix analysis to be used throughout the rest of the book. 3. Chapter 3 approaches the Jordan canonical form via the Weyr characteristic; it contains an exposition of the Weyr canonical form and its unitary variant that were not in the first edition. Section 3.2 (Consequences of the Jordan canonical form) discusses many new applications; it contains 60{\%} more material than the corresponding section in the first edition. 4. Chapter 4 now has a modern presentation of variational principles and eigen- value inequalities for Hermitian matrices via subspace intersections. It contains an expanded treatment of inverse problems associated with interlacing and other classical results. Its detailed treatment of unitary congruence includes Youla's theorem (a normal form for a square complex matrix A under unitary congruence that is associated with the eigenstructure of A ¯ A), as well as canonical forms for conjugate normal, congruence normal, and squared normal matrices. It also has an exposition of recently discovered canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence and new algorithms to construct a basis of a coneigenspace. 5. Chapter 5 contains an expanded discussion of norm duality, many new problems, and a treatment of semi-inner products that finds application in a discussion of finite-dimensional quantum systems in Chapter 7. 6. Chapter 6 has a newtreatment of the “disjoint discs” aspect of Gerˇ sgorin's theorem and a reorganized discussion of eigenvalue perturbations, including differentiabil- ity of a simple eigenvalue. 7. Chapter 7 has been reorganized now that the singular value decomposition is introduced in Chapter 2. There is a newtreatment of the polar decomposition, new factorizations related to the singular value decomposition, and special emphasis on rowand column inclusion. The von Neumann trace theorem (proved via Birkhoff's theorem) is now the foundation on which many applications of the singular value decomposition are built. The Loewner partial order and block matrices are treated in detail with new techniques, as are the classical determinant inequalities for positive definite matrices. 8. Chapter 8 uses facts about left eigenvectors developed in Chapter 1 to streamline its exposition of the Perron–Frobenius theory of positive and nonnegative matrices. D. Appendix D contains new explicit perturbation bounds for the zeroes of a poly- nomial and the eigenvalues of a matrix. F. Appendix F tabulates a modern list of canonical forms for a pair of Hermitian matrices, or a pair of matrices, one of which is symmetric and the other is skew symmetric. These canonical pairs are applications of the canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence presented in Chapter 4. Readers who are curious about the technology of book making may be interested to know that this book began as a set of L ATEX files created manually by a company in India from hard copy of the first edition. Those files were edited and revised using the ScientificWorkPlace R ?graphical user interface and typesetting system. The cover art for the second edition was the result of a lucky encounter on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles in spring 2003. The young man in the middle seat said he was an artist who paints abstract paintings that are sometimes mathematically inspired. In the course of friendly conversation, he revealed that his special area of mathematical enjoyment was linear algebra, and that he had studied Matrix Analysis. After mutual expressions of surprise at the chance nature of our meeting, and a pleasant discussion, we agreed that appropriate cover artwould enhance the visual appeal of the second edition; he said he would send something to consider. In due course a packet arrived from Seattle. It contained a letter and a stunning 4.5- by 5-inch color photograph, identified on the back as an image of a 72- by 66-inch oil on canvas, painted in 2002. The letter said that “the painting is entitled Surprised Again on the Diagonal and is inspired by the recurring prevalence of the diagonal in math whether it be in geometry, analysis, algebra, set theory or logic. I think that it would be an attractive addition to your wonderful book.” Thank you, Lun-Yi Tsai, for your wonderful cover art! A great many students, instructors, and professional colleagues have contributed to the evolution of this new edition since its predecessor appeared in 1985.

abstract = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws. These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

abstract = {This book presents applications of spectral methods to problems of uncertainty propagation and quantification in model-based computations, focusing on the computational and algorithmic features of these methods most useful in dealing with models based on partial differential equations, in particular models arising in simulations of fluid flows. Spectral stochastic methods are probabilistic in nature, and are consequently rooted in the rich mathematical foundations associated with probability and measure spaces. A brief discussion is provided of only those theoretical aspects needed to set the stage for subsequent applications. These are demonstrated through detailed treatments of elementary problems, as well as in more elaborate examples involving vortex-dominated flows and compressible flows at low Mach numbers. Some recent developments are also outlined in the book, including iterative techniques (such as stochastic multigrids and Newton schemes), intrusive and non-intrusive formalisms, spectral representations using mixed and discontinuous bases, multi-resolution approximations, and adaptive techniques. Readers are assumed to be familiar with elementary methods for the numerical solution of time-dependent, partial differential equations; prior experience with spectral approximation is helpful but not essential.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Barrett1995,
abstract = {Which of the following statements is true? • Users want “black box” software that they can use with complete confidence for general problem classes without having to understand the fine algorithmic details. • Users want to be able to tune data structures for a particular application, even if the software is not as reliable as that provided for general methods. It turns out both are true, for different groups of users. Traditionally, users have asked for and been provided with black box software in the form of mathematical libraries such as LAPACK, LINPACK, NAG, and IMSL. More recently, the high performance community has discovered that they must write custom software for their problem. Their reasons include inadequate functionality of existing software libraries, data structures that are not natural or convenient for a particular problem, and overly general software that sacrifices too much performance when applied to a special case of interest. Can we meet the needs of both groups of users? We believe we can. Accordingly, in this book, we introduce the use of templates. A template is a description of a general algorithm rather than the executable object code or the source code more commonly found in a conventional software library. Nevertheless, although templates are general descriptions of key algorithms, they offer whatever degree of customization the user may desire. For example, they can be configured for the specific data structure of a problem or for the specific computing system on which the problem is to run. We focus on the use of iterative methods for solving large sparse systems of linear equations. Many methods exist for solving such problems. The trick is to find the most effective method for the problem at hand. Unfortunately, a method that works well for one problem type may not work as well for another. Indeed, it may not work at all. Thus, besides providing templates, we suggest how to choose and implement an effective method, and how to specialize a method to specific matrix types. We restrict ourselves to iter ative methods, which work by repeatedly improving an approximate solution until it is accurate enough. These methods access the coefficient matrix A of the linear system only via the matrix vector product y = A {\textperiodcentered} x (and perhaps z = A T {\textperiodcentered} x). Thus the user need only supply a subroutine for computing y (and perhaps z) given x, which permits full exploitation of the sparsity or other special structure of A. We believe that after reading this book, applications developers will be able to use templates to get their program running on a parallel machine quickly. Nonspecialists will know how to choose and implement an approach to solve a particular problem. Specialists will be able to assemble and modify their codes—without having to make the huge investment that has, up to now, been required to tune large-scale applications for each particular machine. Finally, we hope that all users will gain a better understanding of the algorithms employed. While education has not been one of 1 the traditional goals of mathematical software, we believe that our approach will go a long way in providing such a valuable service.},

The ultrasonic propagation in cancellous bone is modeled using the Biot theory modified by the Johnson et al. model for viscous exchange between fluid and structure. The sensitivity of the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame is studied showing their effect on the fast and slow wave forms. The inverse problem is solved numerically by the least squares method. Five parameters are inverted: the porosity, tortuosity, viscous characteristic length, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame. The minimization of the discrepancy between experiment and theory is made in the time domain. The inverse problem is shown to be well posed, and its solution to be unique. Experimental results for slow and fast waves transmitted through human cancellous bone samples are given and compared with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {The previous chapters have displayed examples of partial differential equations in various fields of mathematical physics. Attention has been paid to the interpretation of these equations in the specific contexts they were presented. 1 In fact, we have delineated three types of field equations, namely hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The basic idea that the mathematical nature of these equations was fundamental to their physical significance has been creeping throughout. Still, the formats in which these three types were presented correspond to their canonical forms, that is, a form that one recognizes at first glance. Such is not the general case. For example, it is not obvious (to this author at least!) that the following second order equation, 2 ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − 4 ∂ 2 u ∂x∂t − 6 ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 + ∂u ∂x = 0 , is of hyperbolic type. In other words, it shares essential physical properties with the wave equation, ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 = 0 . Indeed, this is the aim of the present chapter to show that all equations of mathematical physics can be recast in these three fundamental types. By the same token, we introduce a new notion, that of a characteristic curve. A method to solve IBVPs based on characteristics will be exposed in the next chapter. The terminology used to coin the three types of PDEs borrows from geometry, as the criterion will be seen to rely on the nature of the roots of quadratic equations. We envisage in turn first of order equations, sets of first order equations, and second order equations. The use of a common terminology to class first and second order equations is challenged by the fact that a set of two first order equation may be transformed into a second},

abstract = {A computationally efficient method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. The method formally discretizes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid. Operations are limited to a finite computational domain through a lattice Green's function technique. This technique obtains solutions to inhomogeneous difference equations through the discrete convolution of source terms with the fundamental solutions of the discrete operators. The differential algebraic equations describing the temporal evolution of the discrete momentum equation and incompressibility constraint are numerically solved by combining an integrating factor technique for the viscous term and a half-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the convective term. A projection method that exploits the mimetic and commutativity properties of the discrete operators is used to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises in each stage of the time integration scheme. Linear complexity, fast computation rates, and parallel scalability are achieved using recently developed fast multipole methods for difference equations. The accuracy and physical fidelity of solutions are verified through numerical simulations of vortex rings.},

abstract = {Hydraulic transients in closed conduits have been a subject of both theoretical study and intense practical interest for more than one hundred years. While straightforward in terms of the one-dimensional nature of pipe networks, the full description of transient fluid flows pose interesting problems in fluid dynamics. For example, the response of the turbulence structure and strength to transient waves in pipes and the loss of flow axisymmetry in pipes due to hydrodynamic instabilities are currently not understood. Yet, such understanding is important for modeling energy dissipation and water quality in transient pipe flows. This paper presents an overview of both historic developments and present day research and practice in the field of hydraulic transients. In particular, the paper discusses mass and momentum equations for one-dimensional Flows, wavespeed, numerical solutions for one-dimensional problems, wall shear stress models; two-dimensional mass and momentum equations, turbulence models, numerical solutions for two-dimensional problems, boundary conditions, transient analysis software, and future practical and research needs in water hammer. The presentation emphasizes the assumptions and restrictions involved in various governing equations so as to illuminate the range of applicability as well as the limitations of these equations. Understanding the limitations of current models is essential for (i) interpreting their results, (ii) judging the reliability of the data obtained from them, (iii) minimizing misuse of water-hammer models in both research and practice, and (iv) delineating the contribution of physical processes from the contribution of numerical artifacts to the results of waterhammer models.

Deletions and duplications of DNA strands of between a few hundred bp and several million bp-collectively referred to as copy number variants-are now known to be widespread. Since 2007, rigorous and adequately powered genome-wide association studies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms have yielded replicated associations to several common diseases. Some copy number variants explain rare, previously uncharacterised disorders, and they are now expected to explain some of the genetic contribution to common diseases. We review efforts to map copy number variants and discuss present and future prospects for assessment of their relation to human health and disease.},

The author follows a consistent philosophy of control volume formulation of the fundamental laws of fluid motion and energy transfer, and introduces a novel notion of ‘smoothing pressure correction' for solution of flow equations on collocated grids within the framework of the well-known SIMPLE algorithm. The subject matter is developed by considering pure conduction/diffusion, convective transport in 2-dimensional boundary layers and in fully elliptic flow situations and phase-change problems in succession. The book includes chapters on discretization of equations for transport of mass, momentum and energy on Cartesian, structured curvilinear and unstructured meshes, solution of discretised equations, numerical grid generation and convergence enhancement.

abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

abstract = {Time dependent problems frequently pose challenges in areas of science and engineering dealing with numerical analysis, scientific computation, mathematical models, and most importantly--numerical experiments intended to analyze physical behavior and test design. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods addresses these various industrial considerations in a pragmatic and detailed manner, giving special attention to time dependent problems in its coverage of the derivation and analysis of numerical methods for computational approximations to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The book is written in two parts. Part I discusses problems with periodic solutions; Part II proceeds to discuss initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations and numerical methods for them. The problems with periodic solutions have been chosen because they allow the application of Fourier analysis without the complication that arises from the infinite domain for the corresponding Cauchy problem. Furthermore, the analysis of periodic problems provides necessary conditions when constructing methods for initial boundary value problems. Much of the material included in Part II appears for the first time in this book. The authors draw on their own interests and combined extensive experience in applied mathematics and computer science to bring about this practical and useful guide. They provide complete discussions of the pertinent theorems and back them up with examples and illustrations. For physical scientists, engineers, or anyone who uses numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena, this invaluable guide is destined to become a constant companion. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations. What Every Physical Scientist and Engineer Needs to Know About Time Dependent Problems . . . Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods covers the analysis of numerical methods for computing approximate solutions to partial differential equations for time dependent problems. This original book includes for the first time a concrete discussion of initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations. The authors have redone many of these results especially for this volume, including theorems, examples, and over one hundred illustrations. The book takes some less-than-obvious approaches to developing its material: * Treats differential equations and numerical methods with a parallel development, thus achieving a more useful analysis of numerical methods * Covers hyperbolic equations in particularly great detail * Emphasizes error bounds and estimates, as well as the sufficient results needed to justify the methods used for applications Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is written for physical scientists and engineers who use numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena.

A series of two experimental investigations were carried out on a 6m vertical pipe with a 0.067m internal diameter charged with an air–silicone oil mixture. For the first set of experiments, the riser was initially full of air, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and wire mesh sensor (WMS) transducers were employed. In the second one, the riser was initially full of (static) liquid, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, only ECT was used. A characterisation of the observed slug flow regimes was carried out. This includes the evaluation of the instantaneous distribution of the phases over the pipe cross-section, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of void fraction, time series of cross-sectional void fraction, Power Spectral Density (PSD), structure velocity of the Taylor bubble, lengths of the liquid slug and Taylor bubble and void fractions in the liquid slug and Taylor bubble. The simulation results were validated both qualitatively and quantitatively against experimental data. A reasonably good agreement was observed between the results of the experiment and CFD.},

abstract = {An investigation of time marching computational fluid-structure interaction algorithms is presented. The analysis is applied to the piston problem. Attention is focussed on the time integration properties of the coupling algorithms. The staggered scheme is first investigated where fluid and structure are alternately integrated by separate solvers in a predictor-corrector fashion. This algorithm suffers from a time lag between the integration of the fluid and structure. The influence of the time lag is investigated by the comparison of different predictions for the structure. A novel monolithical algorithm is then introduced in order to annihilate the time lag. This algorithm integrates fluid, structure and interaction as a single system by an implicit algorithm. Linear acoustic as well as nonlinear Euler equations for gas dynamics are investigated. The numerical results of the staggered scheme reveal a non-physical deviation of the mean position of the piston at higher CFL numbers. The deviation of the mean position is not present in the calculation with the monolithical scheme. Stability analysis shows the unconditional stability of the monolithical scheme for the acoustic equations whereas the staggered scheme has a limited domain of stability. This domain can be enlarged by an improvement of the structural prediction. Analysis of the damping shows an energy production in the staggered scheme while the monolithical scheme has no energy production term. The analyses lead to the formulation of the Interaction Consistency Law which prescribes the relation for the time discretisation between fluid and structure solvers and their boundary conditions.},

Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

abstract = {In this paper and in part II, we give the theory of a distinctive type of wave motion, which arises in any one-dimensional flow problem when there is an approximate functional relation at each point between the flow q (quantity passing a given point in unit time) and concentration k (quantity per unit distance). The wave property then follows directly from the equation of continuity satisfied by q and k. In view of this, these waves are described as 'kinematic', as distinct from the classical wave motions, which depend also on Newton's second law of motion and are therefore called 'dynamic'. Kinematic waves travel with the velocity [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}q/[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}k, and the flow q remains constant on each kinematic wave. Since the velocity of propagation of each wave depends upon the value of q carried by it, successive waves may coalesce to form 'kinematic shock waves'. From the point of view of kinematic wave theory, there is a discontinuous increase in q at a shock, but in reality a shock wave is a relatively narrow region in which (owing to the rapid increase of q) terms neglected by the flow-concentration relation become important. The general properties of kinematic waves and shock waves are discussed in detail in section 1. One example included in section 1 is the interpretation of the group-velocity phenomenon in a dispersive medium as a particular case of the kinematic wave phenomenon. The remainder of part I is devoted to a detailed treatment of flood movement in long rivers, a problem in which kinematic waves play the leading role although dynamic waves (in this case, the long gravity waves) also appear. First (section 2), we consider the variety of factors which can influence the approximate flow-concentration relation, and survey the various formulae which have been used in attempts to describe it. Then follows a more mathematical section (section 3) in which the role of the dynamic waves is clarified. From the full equations of motion for an idealized problem it is shown that at the 'Froude numbers' appropriate to flood waves, the dynamic waves are rapidly attenuated and the main disturbance is carried downstream by the kinematic waves; some account is then given of the behaviour of the flow at higher Froude numbers. Also in section 3, the full equations of motion are used to investigate the structure of the kinematic shock; for this problem, the shock is the 'monoclinal flood wave' which is well known in the literature of this subject. The final sections (section section 4 and 5) contain the application of the theory of kinematic waves to the determination of flood movement. In section 4 it is shown how the waves (including shock waves) travelling downstream from an observation point may be deduced from a knowledge of the variation with time of the flow at the observation point; this section then concludes with a brief account of the effect on the waves of tributaries and run-off. In section 5, the modifications (similar to diffusion effects) which arise due to the slight dependence of the flow-concentration curve on the rate of change of flow or concentration, are described and methods for their inclusion in the theory are given.},

Bubbles of different volumes were studied, their lengths varying from 30 to 100 times the pipe diameter. Two different shapes were observed corresponding to plug and slug flow regimes. The transition between plug and slug flow was shown to depend on both Froude number and bubble length. A model based on the mass and momentum conservation equations of each phase is proposed. It is able to predict the transition between plug and slug flow regimes as well as the volume and the shape of long bubbles. It is shown that usual slug flow codes that aim to predict the void fraction tend to overestimate the gas fraction in the bubble region. The model may be easily implemented into slug tracking codes.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of the Error-in-Variable Model (EVM), a type of parameter estimation techniques, for the determination of the internal pipe wall surface conditions (effective surface roughness) of pipe segments in complex natural gas pipeline networks and sub-lateral gathering networks. This technique uses SCADA data collected over a period of time such as pressures, temperatures and flow rates at boundary points of the network, i.e. at receipt and delivery points. These data are used as input to the EVM along with pertinent objective functions that are based on dimensional mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The main focus of the technique is to extract reliable and accurate information with regard to the internal wall surface condition of pipe segments within the network that are showing evidence of fouling or under-performing from the flow efficiency perspective. The EVM is most suited for this problem as it accounts for uncertainties in the SCADA data from errors in the measurement instrumentations, the time averaging processing of the data and the inherent assumption of the quasi-steadiness of the flow rates. Insight into the implication of pipe segments arranged in series or in parallel within the network is highlighted. Guidance as to the relationship between the number of necessary distinct data sets required for a given number of parameters (surface roughness of pipe segments) to be estimated and the number of independent objective functions that can be written for a given network is provided. Finally, the EVM technique is demonstrated by an existing sub-lateral natural gas receipt network feeding into a main gas transmission pipeline (DN750), 21.1km upstream of a compressor station.},

@article{Quaini2009,
abstract = {We discuss in this thesis the numerical approximation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with a particular concern (albeit not exclusive) on hemodynamics applications. Firstly, we model the blood as an incompressible fluid and the artery wall as an elastic structure. To solve the coupled problem, we propose new semi-implicit algorithms based on inexact block-LU factorization of the linear system obtained after the space-time discretization and linearization of the FSI problem. As a result, the fluid velocity is computed separately from the coupled pressure-structure velocity system at each iteration, hence reducing the computational cost. This approach leads to two different families of methods which extend to FSI problems schemes that were previously adopted for pure fluid problems. The algorithms derived from inexact factorization methods are compared with other schemes based on two preconditioners for the FSI system. The first one is the classical Dirichlet-Neumann preconditioner, which has the advantage of modularity (i.e. it allows to reuse existing fluid and structure codes with minimum effort). Unfortunately, its performance is very poor in case of large added-mass effect, as it happens in hemodynamics. Alternatively, we consider a non-modular approach which consists in preconditioning the coupled system with a suitable diagonal scaling combined with an ILUT preconditioner. The system is then solved by a Krylov method. The drawback of this procedure is the loss of modularity. Independently of the preconditioner, the efficiency of semi-implicit algorithms is highlighted. All the methods are tested on two and three-dimensional blood-vessel systems. The algorithm combining the non-modular ILUT preconditioner with Krylov methods proved to be the fastest. However, modular and inexact factorization based methods should not be disregarded because they can considerably benefit from code parallelization, unlike the ILUT-Krylov approach. Finally, we improve the structure model by representing the vessel wall as a linear poroelastic medium. Our non-modular approach and the partitioned procedures arising from a domain decomposition viewpoint are extended to fluid-poroelastic structure interactions. Their numerical performance are analyzed and compared on simplified blood-vessel systems.},

The photographic studies show that the transition from plug to slug flow occurs when the back of the bubble changes from staircase pattern to hydraulic jump with the increase of the Froude number and bubble length. The effect of pipe inclination on characteristics of bubble is significant: The bubble is inversely located in a downwardly inclined pipe when the Froude number is low, and the transition from plug flow to slug flow in an upward inclined pipe is more ready to occur compared with that in a downwardly inclined pipe.},

abstract = {In this work, large eddy simulation data is analyzed to investigate a new stochastic modeling approach for the wake of a wind turbine. The data is generated by the LES model PALM combined with an actuator disk with rotation representing the turbine. After applying a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), three different stochastic models for the weighting coefficients of the POD modes are deduced resulting in three wake models. Their performance is investigated mainly on the basis of aeroelastic simulations of a wind turbine in the wake. Three different load cases and their statistic characteristics are compared for the original LES, truncated PODs and the stochastic wake models including different numbers of POD modes. It is shown that approximately six POD modes are enough to capture the load dynamics on large temporal scales. Modeling the weighting coefficients as independent stochastic processes leads to similar load characteristics as in the case of the truncated POD. To complete this simplified wake description, we show evidence that the small-scale dynamics can be grasped by adding to our model a homogeneous turbulent field. In this way, we present a procedure how to derive stochastic wake models from costly CFD calculations or elaborated experimental investigations. These numerically efficient models provide the added value of possible long-term studies. Depending on the aspects of interest, different minimalized models may be obtained.},

abstract = {Wind tunnel measurements were performed for the wake produced by a three-bladed wind turbine immersed in uniform flow. These tests show the presence of a vorticity structure in the near-wake region mainly oriented along the streamwise direction, which is denoted as the hub vortex. The hub vortex is characterized by oscillations with frequencies lower than that connected to the rotational velocity of the rotor, which previous works have ascribed to wake meandering. This phenomenon consists of transversal oscillations of the wind turbine wake, which might be excited by the vortex shedding from the rotor disc acting as a bluff body. In this work, temporal and spatial linear stability analyses of a wind turbine wake are performed on a base flow obtained with time-averaged wind tunnel velocity measurements. This study shows that the low-frequency spectral component detected experimentally matches the most amplified frequency of the counter-winding single-helix mode downstream of the wind turbine. Then, simultaneous hot-wire measurements confirm the presence of a helicoidal unstable mode of the hub vortex with a streamwise wavenumber roughly equal to that predicted from the linear stability analysis.},

We first present the model correction in a general form, involving both external correction and internal correction. The model correction problem is then parameterized and casted into an optimization problem, from which the parameters are determined. More importantly, we discuss the incorporation of physical constraints from the underlying physical problem. Several representative examples are presented, where the physical constraints take very different forms. Numerical tests demonstrate that the physics constrained model correction is an effective way to address model-form uncertainty.},

abstract = {Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) represents an effective means for capturing the essential features of numerically or experimentally generated flow fields. In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. Sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the l1-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems. Several examples of flow fields resulting from numerical simulations and physical experiments are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method. {\~{A}}{\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {In the field of uncertainty quantification, uncertainty in the governing equations may assume two forms: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty can be characterised by known probability distributions whilst epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge of probabilistic information. While extensive research efforts have been devoted to the numerical treatment of aleatory uncertainty, little attention has been given to the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a numerical framework for quantification of epistemic uncertainty. The proposed methodology does not require any probabilistic information on uncertain input parameters. The method only necessitates an estimate of the range of the uncertain variables that encapsulates the true range of the input variables with overwhelming probability. To quantify the epistemic uncertainty, we solve an encapsulation problem, which is a solution to the original governing equations defined on the estimated range of the input variables. We discuss solution strategies for solving the encapsulation problem and the sufficient conditions under which the numerical solution can serve as a good estimator for capturing the effects of the epistemic uncertainty. In the case where probability distributions of the epistemic variables become known a posteriori, we can use the information to post-process the solution and evaluate solution statistics. Convergence results are also established for such cases, along with strategies for dealing with mixed aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the procedure and properties of the proposed methodology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs.},

abstract = {There exists a sharp density jump at the fluid interfaces in most of interfacial flows encountered in engineering applications. Numerical treatment of the discontinuous fluid density in such flows is a great challenge. In particular, numerical errors can lead to non-physical results at large density ratios, hence limit a flow solver to only small and usually unrealistic density ratios. We introduce a consistent mass and momentum transport method which allows for simulations of interfacial flows with large density ratios in the context of the level set method. Fluid momentum is transported by discretizing the conservative form of the convective term in the momentum equation. A new technique is introduced to compute the flux density based on the temporal evolution of the fluid interfaces and by using the level set function at two subsequent time levels. For consistency, we use the same flux density for both mass and momentum transport, and thereby establish a tight coupling between them. We assess the performance of the proposed method by using a set of benchmark test cases, in which the density ratio ranges from 650 to 10 6. The new method is stable and accurate even at extreme density ratios. The numerical results agree very well with the theoretical and experimental results. In contrast, the results of a non-conservative formulation show non-physical fluid behavior, where the dense fluid is slowed down by the light fluid due to numerical errors. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The flow field is obtained from the discrete solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, whereas a conservative level-set method is employed to capture fluid interfaces on an Eulerian approach. The scheme is based on a novel treatment of the interface for the deactivation of the light phase, allowing an optimization of the classic two-phase model for the cases in which the influence of the lighter phase is negligible. The deactivation is performed by directly imposing the appropriate pressure at the surface boundary, and, unlike similar approaches, without the need to treat near-interface velocities. The method is validated against various analytical and experimental references, demonstrating its potential on both hexahedral and unstructured meshes. Moreover, it shows higher numerical stability in comparison to two-phase solvers, as well as significant advantages in terms of computational performance.},

abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real-time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors.},

The underlying generalised sparse grid algorithm greedily selects the dimensions and variable interactions that contribute most to the variability of a function. The hierarchical surplus of points within the sparse grid is used as an error criterion for local refinement with the aim of concentrating computational effort within rapidly varying or discontinuous regions. This approach limits the number of points that are invested in `unimportant' dimensions and regions within the high-dimensional domain.

abstract = {Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes$\backslash$n(RANS)$\backslash$nmodels are widely used in industry to predict fluid flows, despite their acknowledged deficiencies. Not only do RANS$\backslash$nmodels often produce inaccurate flow predictions, but there are very limited diagnostics available to assess RANS accuracy for a given flow configuration. If experimental or higher fidelity simulation results are not available for RANS validation, there is no reliable method to evaluate RANS accuracy. This paper explores the potential of utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify regions of high RANS uncertainty. Three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated: support vector machines, Adaboost decision trees, and random forests. The algorithms were trained on a database of canonical flow configurations for which validated direct numerical simulation or large eddy simulation results were available, and were used to classify RANS results on a point-by-point basis as having either high or low uncertainty, based on the breakdown of specific RANS$\backslash$nmodeling assumptions. Classifiers were developed for three different basic RANS$\backslash$neddy$\backslash$nviscosity$\backslash$nmodel assumptions: the isotropy of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity, the linearity of the Boussinesq hypothesis, and the non-negativity of the eddy$\backslash$nviscosity. It is shown that these classifiers are able to generalize to flows substantially different from those on which they were trained. Feature selection techniques, model evaluation, and extrapolation detection are discussed in the context of turbulence modeling applications.},

abstract = {The most significant result of the present exercise is to identify a correct error propagation equation that also accounts for dispersion error. It is shown that when this is included, the correct error evolution equation (17) for the scalar advection equation is not the one given by the traditional method due to von Neumann that assumes the signal and error to satisfy the same equation. Eq. (17) is obtained here for the first time, showing the dispersion error to change the actual constant phase speed to a variable numerical phase speed cN. This error c(1 - cN/c), gives rise to additional forcing on the right-hand side of Eq. (17) dependent upon this error times the spatial gradient of numerical solution. The propagation of a ramp function is studied to demonstrate how the spatial gradient of signal affects error dynamics. In the process, we explain the genesis and evolution of Gibbs' phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds stresses obtained therefrom.},

One approach consists in first applying a semi-discretization in time by a fully implicit ??-scheme. Then, in each discrete time, the equations are linearized by a fixed point iteration. The number of iterations to reach a given stopping criterion is a priori unknown in this approach. In the second approach, Rosenbrock schemes with s stages are used as temporal discretization. The non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes equations is treated internally in the Rosenbrock methods. In each discrete time, exactly s linear systems of equations have to be solved. The numerical study considers five two-dimensional problems with distinct features. Four implicit time stepping schemes and five Rosenbrock methods are involved. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the turbulence modeling community, significant efforts have been made to quantify the uncertainties in the Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models and to improve their predictive capabilities. Of crucial importance in these efforts is the understanding of the discrepancies in the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. However, to what extent these discrepancies can be predicted or whether they are completely random remains a fundamental open question. In this work we used a machine learning algorithm based on random forest regression to predict the discrepancies. The success of the regression--prediction procedure indicates that, to a large extent, the discrepancies in the modeled Reynolds stresses can be explained by the mean flow feature, and thus they are universal quantities that can be extrapolated from one flow to another, at least among different flows sharing the same characteristics such as separation. This finding has profound implications to the future development of RANS models, opening up new possibilities for data-driven predictive turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {We present results from a study of buoyant miscible displacements flows at moderate viscosity ratios in near-horizontal ducts. Low Atwood numbers are considered. Inertial effects are significant although the flow regimes are laminar. Pipe and plane channel geometries are considered using a mix of experimental, computational and analytical techniques. The main focus of the study is on the effects of the viscosity ratio between the fluids. We show that small viscosity ratios lead to more efficient displacements, as is intuitive. In each geometry we find a mix of viscous and inertial flows, in broadly the same pattern as for the iso-viscous displacements studied extensively in Taghavi et al. (submitted for publication). Predictive models are proposed for the viscous regime, in the case of the plane channel, and for the inertial exchange flow regime, in both geometries. We also study displacement flows with shear-thinning fluids, over a more restrictive range of parameters. We show that with an appropriate definition of the effective viscosity the scaled front velocities fit well with the results from the Newtonian displacements, in both pipe and plane channel geometries. The main role of ratio m of displaced fluid viscosity to displacing viscosity is in line with our intuition. For m{\textgreater}. 1 displacement efficiencies are reduced and the front velocities are larger. However, the main increase in front velocity is achieved for modest viscosity ratios of 3 or 4 to 1, with little increase afterwards. The reverse situation, m{\textless}. 1, shows significant improvements in displacement efficiency, with front velocity V{\^{}} f reduced down towards the imposed mean velocity V{\^{}} 0, as m decreases. A viscosity ratio of around 1-4 appears to achieve quite efficient displacements, and to be able to compensate for the effects of buoyancy (which in our case are always destabilising). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

To solve the equations efficiently and accurately, we employ Chorin's projection method for the modified Navier-Stokes equations, and the recently developed practically unconditionally stable method for the multi-component Cahn-Hilliard equations. We numerically investigate the effects of various density ratios, tilt angles, Reynolds numbers, and Weber numbers on the interface structures and front velocities.

The dynamic viscosity differences give rise to less marked effects, unless back-mixing becomes significant.

Two test loops with pipe diameters of 27. mm and 41. mm I.D. with diesel flow were used. Water withdrawal from tapping valves distributed along the up-hill section enabled to follow the water displacement for oil flow rates exceeding the critical value.A model for predicting the water displacement by the oil flow, which is based on the formation of a water plug in the lowest (horizontal) section, is suggested. The predicted amounts of water withdrawn from the tapping valves favorably compare with the experimental results. Considering other competing mechanisms, up-scaling to larger pipe diameters is examined. The analysis indicates that water plug formation appears to be the controlling mechanism for water displacement also in larger pipe diameters encountered in field operations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

When a fluid is forced into a pipe already full of another fluid with which it can mix, the interface spreads through a length S as it passes down the pipe. When the interface has moved through a distance X, theory leads to the formula S{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} = 437aX(v{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$}/U). Good agreement is found when this prediction is compared with experiments made in long pipe lines in America.},

@article{Davies1950,
abstract = {Part I describes measurements of the shape and rate of rise of air bubbles varying in volume from 1{\textperiodcentered} 5 to 200 cm.3 when they rise through nitrobenzene or water. Measurements of photographs of bubbles formed in nitrobenzene show that the greater part of the upper surface is always spherical. A theoretical discussion, based on the assumption that the pressure over the front of the bubble is the same as that in ideal hydrodynamic flow round a sphere, shows that the velocity of rise, U, should be related to the radius of curvature, R, in the region of the vertex, by the equation U = 2/3√ (gR); the agreement between this relationship and the experimental results is excellent. For geometrically similar bubbles of such large diameter that the drag coefficient would be independent of Reynolds's number, it would be expected that U would be proportional to the sixth root of the volume, V; measurements of eighty-eight bubbles show considerable scatter in the values of U/V1/6, although there is no systematic variation in the value of this ratio with the volume. Part II. Though the characteristics of a large bubble are associated with the observed fact that the hydrodynamic pressure on the front of a spherical cap moving through a fluid is nearly the same as that on a complete sphere, the mechanics of a rising bubble cannot be completely understood till the observed pressure distribution on a spherical cap is understood. Failing this, the case of a large bubble running up a circular tube filled with water and emptying at the bottom is capable of being analyzed completely because the bubble is not then followed by a wake. An approximate calculation shows that the velocity U of rise is U = 0{\textperiodcentered} 46 √ (ga), where a is the radius of the tube. Experiments with a tube 7{\textperiodcentered} 9 cm. diameter gave values of U from 29{\textperiodcentered} 1 to 30{\textperiodcentered} 6 cm./sec., corresponding with values of U/√ (ga) from 0{\textperiodcentered} 466 to 0{\textperiodcentered} 490.},

abstract = {The reliable predictions of liquid holdup and pressure drop are essential for pipeline design in oil and gas industry. In this study, the drift-flux approach is utilized to calculate liquid holdups. This approach has been widely used in formulation of the basic equations for multiphase flow in pipelines. Most of the drift-flux models have been developed on an empirical basis from the experimental data. Even though, previous studies showed that these models can be applied to different flow pattern and pipe inclination, when the distribution parameter is flow pattern dependent. They are limited to a set of fluid properties, pipe geometries and operational conditions. The objective of this study is to develop a new drift-flux closure relationship for prediction of liquid holdups in pipes that can be easily applied to a wide range of flow conditions. The developed correlation is compared with nine available correlations from literatures, and validated using the TUFFP (Fluid Flow Projects of University of Tulsa) experimental datasets and OLGA (OiL and GAs simulator supplied by SPTgroup) steady-state synthetic data generated by OLGA Multiphase Toolkit. The developed correlation performs better in predicting liquid holdups than the available correlations for a wide range of flow conditions.},

Therefore, there is a continuous need to find a 'good' wake model to properly plan wind power plant-level control strategies, predict the performance and understand the fatigue loads of turbines. In this paper, six widely used approaches of wake modelling (Jensen, Larsen, Dynamic Wake Meandering, Fuga and, Ellipsys3D LES and RANS together with their interpretations) that were developed at Technical University of Denmark, are described and the model subcomponents are analysed. The models are evaluated using data from the Sexbierum (onshore) and the Lillgrund (offshore) wind farms to understand how to best utilize them. The paper provides a comprehensive conceptual background to wake modelling combined with the overview of the state-of-the-art models including their implementations on operating wind farms.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and stochastic collocation (SC) meth- ods are attractive techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to their strong math- ematical basis and ability to produce functional representations of stochastic variability. PCE estimates coefficients for known orthogonal polynomial basis functions based on a set of response function evaluations, using sampling, linear regression, tensor-product quadra- ture, or Smolyak sparse grid approaches. SC, on the other hand, forms interpolation functions for known coefficients, and requires the use of structured collocation point sets derived from tensor-products or sparse grids. When tailoring the basis functions or inter- polation grids to match the forms of the input uncertainties, exponential convergence rates can be achieved with both techniques for general probabilistic analysis problems. In this paper, we explore relative performance of these methods using a number of simple alge- braic test problems, and analyze observed differences. In these computational experiments, performance of PCE and SC is shown to be very similar, although when differences are evident, SC is the consistent winner over traditional PCE formulations. This stems from the practical difficulty of optimally synchronizing the form of the PCE with the integration approach being employed, resulting in slight over- or under-integration of prescribed ex- pansion form. With additional nontraditional tailoring of PCE form, it is shown that this performance gap can be reduced, and in some cases, eliminated.},

abstract = {The rise velocity of tube-draining bubbles in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids has been studied for vertical and inclined tubes. The experimental data are described in terms of the Froude (Fr), Eotvos (Eo), and Morton (M) numbers. The Froude number is given as a function of the angle of inclination (O) and Eo in order to represent the effect of tube size, inclination angle, and fluid properties on the rise velocity of the bubble. As the angle of inclination from the horizontal increases, Fr increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases for all fluids. The maximum Fr value occurs at larger angles of inclination when the fluid is non-Newtonian. For Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids possessing similar values of surface tension and zero-shear rate viscosity, the Fr values are similar for vertical tubes. However, the Fr values are generally lower for non-Newtonian fluids in inclined tubes under these same conditions. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Li2015,
abstract = {We present a novel way of deciding when and where to refine a mesh in probability space in order to facilitate uncertainty quantification in the presence of discontinuities in random space. A discontinuity in random space makes the application of generalized polynomial chaos expansion techniques prohibitively expensive. The reason is that for discontinuous problems, the expansion converges very slowly. An alternative to using higher terms in the expansion is to divide the random space in smaller elements where a lower degree polynomial is adequate to describe the randomness. In general, the partition of the random space is a dynamic process since some areas of the random space, particularly around the discontinuity, need more refinement than others as time evolves. In the current work we propose a way to decide when and where to refine the random space mesh based on the use of a reduced model. The idea is that a good reduced model can monitor accurately, within a random space element, the cascade of activity to higher degree terms in the chaos expansion. In turn, this facilitates the efficient allocation of computational sources to the areas of random space where they are more needed. For the Kraichnan-Orszag system, the prototypical system to study discontinuities in random space, we present theoretical results which show why the proposed method is sound and numerical results which corroborate the theory.},

abstract = {An extension for 1-D transient two-phase flows of the SIMPLE-ESDIRK method, initially developed for incompressible viscous flows by Ijaz is presented. This extension is motivated by the high temporal order of accuracy demanded to cope with fast phase change events. This methodology is suitable for boiling heat exchangers, solar thermal receivers, etc. The methodology of the solution consist in a finite volume staggered grid discretization of the governing equations in which the transient terms are treated with the explicit first stage singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) method. It is suitable for stiff differential equations, present in instant boiling or condensation processes. It is combined with the semi-implicit pressure linked equations algorithm (SIMPLE) for the calculation of the pressure field. The case of study consists of the numerical reproduction of the Bartolomei upward boiling pipe flow experiment. The steady-state validation of the numerical algorithm is made against these experimental results and well known numerical results for that experiment. In addition, a detailed study reveals the benefits over the first order Euler Backward method when applying 3rd and 4th order schemes, making emphasis in the behaviour when the system is subjected to periodic square wave wall heat function disturbances, concluding that the use of the ESDIRK method in two-phase calculations presents remarkable accuracy and computational advantages.},

abstract = {Flow structures and phase distributions in two- and three-phase stratified and slug flows were studied with a fast-response X-ray tomography system. A large number of experiments were carried out in a 25m long near-horizontal pipeline with an internal diameter of 100mm. A dense gas, SF6, was used to simulate the gas phase in high-pressure gas-condensate pipelines. Detailed measurements of the flow were made with the X-ray system at various superficial velocities, two different pressures (4 and 7.2 bara, giving gas densities of 24 and 42kg/m3, respectively), and three different inclination angles: 0, +1 and +5 degrees. Both qualitative observations and quantitative measurements were obtained which illustrate the different types of interface structure and fluid flow behaviour. The detailed measurements have also been used to obtain a more reliable correlation for predicting the fraction of gas bubbles entrained in the liquid layer in turbulent stratified gas-liquid flows. The measurements in three-phase slug flows reveal interesting phenomena regarding the interactions of the oil-water and gas-oil interfaces. Depending on the flow conditions, the oil-water interface can sometimes decouple from the gas-liquid interface, leading to oil-dominated slugs flowing on top of a water layer of nearly constant thickness.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A new set of measurements of pressure drops and liquid hold-up taken at TEASistemi Laboratory under conditions of stratified gas-liquid flow has been used to improve the closure relations adopted in MAST, a new transient one-dimensional multiphase flow simulator. These data are relative to water-nitrogen flow in a 3.15 in (80 mm) horizontal pipe operating at pressures in the range 72.5-362.6 psig (5-25 bar). The results obtained allowed a more reliable description of stratified gas-liquid flow in hydrocarbon transportation pipelines. A comparison with the performance of other flow simulators is also presented. INTRODUCTION The simulation of gas-liquid flow in pipelines can be based on the solution of 1-D mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, [1]. These equations depend on a set of closure relations, in general of empirical nature. The closures adopted in commercial codes are similar to those proposed in the open literature, on the basis of data taken at atmospheric pressure, in small diameter pipes. These correlations have then been modified on the basis of experimental data taken at conditions which more closely resemble field conditions. Field data are used for the final validation of these codes. Notwithstanding the amount of work performed for code testing and validation, quite often the simulation of real pipelines remains unsatisfactory, the reason probably being that from one hand t},

Unlike the conventional explicit integration schemes, it is not based on a standard CFL condition. Instead, the eigenvalues of the dynamical system are analytically bounded and the linear stability domain of the time-integration scheme is adapted in order to maximize the time step. The method works independently of the underlying spatial mesh; therefore, it can be easily integrated into structured or unstructured codes. The additional computational cost is minimal, and a significant increase of the time step is achieved without losing accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated on both a Cartesian staggered and an unstructured collocated formulation. In practice, CPU cost reductions up to more than 4 with respect to the conventional approach have been measured.},

Consequently, by including the interfacial pressure jump terms with the modified semi-implicit method, the numerical calculations of the void discontinuity propagation and water faucet problems can become more stable and sound than those calculated by using virtual mass terms. ?? 2009 IMACS.},

abstract = {A new approach to chemistry modeling for large eddy simulation of turbulent react- ing flows is developed. Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modeling the unclosed chemical source terms, the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach, whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Presently, only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable, which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer, and a progress variable, which tracks the global extent-of-reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions, which de- scribe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables, are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast chemistry and steady flamelet models for predicting ve- locity, species concentration, and temperature fields in a methane-fueled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available. The progress-variable approach is able to capture the unsteady, lifted flame dynamics observed in the experiment, and to obtain good agreement with the experimental data and sig- nificantly outperform the fast chemistry and steady flamelet models, which both predict an attached flame. –},

The skew-symmetric splitting of the nonlinear term is a well-known approach to obtain semi-discrete conservation of energy in the inviscid limit. However, its computation is roughly twice as expensive as that of the divergence or advective forms alone. A novel time-advancement strategy that retains the conservation properties of skew-symmetric-based schemes at a reduced computational cost has been developed. This method is based on properly constructed Runge-Kutta schemes in which a different form (advective or divergence) for the convective term is adopted at each stage. A general framework is presented to derive schemes with prescribed accuracy on both solution and energy conservation. Simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence show that the new procedure is effective and can be considerably faster than skew-symmetric-based techniques.},

abstract = {Energy-conserving numerical methods are widely employed within the broad area of convection-dominated systems. Semi-discrete conservation of energy is usually obtained by adopting the so-called skew-symmetric splitting of the non-linear convective term, defined as a suitable average of the divergence and advective forms. Although generally allowing global conservation of kinetic energy, it has the drawback of being roughly twice as expensive as standard divergence or advective forms alone. In this paper, a general theoretical framework has been developed to derive an efficient time-advancement strategy in the context of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. The novel technique retains the conservation properties of skew-symmetric-based discretizations at a reduced computational cost. It is found that optimal energy conservation can be achieved by properly constructed Runge-Kutta methods in which only divergence and advective forms for the convective term are used. As a consequence, a considerable improvement in computational efficiency over existing practices is achieved. The overall procedure has proved to be able to produce new schemes with a specified order of accuracy on both solution and energy. The effectiveness of the method as well as the asymptotic behavior of the schemes is demonstrated by numerical simulation of Burgers' equation.},

In this work, an uncertainty quantification and a global sensitivity analysis are performed to quantify the level of confidence of one-dimensional mechanistic models for different flow regimes in two-phase flows. A method is proposed for this purpose accounting for the effect of several variables on pressure drop and hold-up predictions by the well known one-dimensional two-fluid model, such as fluid flow rates, geometry (the inclination angle and the pipe diameter), and fluid properties (density and viscosity); the case of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid behaviour is also considered. Flow pattern transition boundaries, including the stability of the stratified flow regime, are included in this analysis. Monte Carlo simulations and the scatter plot method were used for the uncertainty quantification; the global sensitivity analysis is performed considering the Sobol's method. A discussion is provided considering different practical cases for gas/liquid and liquid/liquid systems and the most critical input parameters in terms of uncertainty are rigorously identified case by case. A way to reduce the output variability is indicated by the interpretation of the results of the global sensitivity analysis. The conclusions of this analysis gives new insights for the experimental validation of two-fluid model predictions.},

abstract = {In the present work, the linear stability of two-layered stratified channel flows to long wave disturbances is studied. In particular, the study addresses the stability of laminar inclined counter-current and concurrent flows in the regions of multiple solutions for the holdup and pressure drop. The analysis is carried out by solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equations for two-plate geometry, through a formal power series in the wave number. The results are summarized in the form of stability boundaries on flow rate maps, which enable a systematic study of the effect of the system physical parameters on the stratified-smooth/wavy transition in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems. It is demonstrated that for counter-current flow there is a region of low flow rates where the two solutions for the holdup are stable. Likewise, the results of concurrent gas-liquid upward flows reveal a region where all three solutions are stable. Moreover, it was found that the middle solution is always stable within the entire 3-s domain. Additionally, the analysis of the wave induced stresses in the axial direction reveals that the terms in phase with the wave slope should be considered in long wave stability analyses of stratified flows. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{NOTABLE,
abstract = { A new discretization scheme named NOTABLE (New Option for the Treatment of Advection in the Boundary Layer Equations) is presented. Despite its name, this scheme is intended to be used in a general transport equation to discretize the convective term. It is formally third‐order accurate in regions of smooth solution and first‐order accurate at grid points having local maxima. Within the finite‐volume formulation it relates the face values to the nodal values via a non‐linear function. This scheme has been compared with well‐known high‐order schemes like QUICK and it has always given more accurate solutions. After assessing the scheme in several unidimensional test cases for which an exact solution is available, its performance in a complex swirling flow is addressed. },

The description of the flow is essentially 1-dimensional. Closure laws concerning mass, momentum and energy exchanges between phases and between each phase and the walls are required. A set of specifically designed separate effect experiments were performed and analysed. Having regard for some development principles, correlations are established on the basis of experimental data. The mechanical transfer laws are derived first from experiments where thermal non equilibrium is negligible. Using them as a basis for further interpretation of experimental data, interfacial heat transfer laws are then developed. Wall heat transfer correlations then have to be fixed. All these steps are presented with emphasis being placed on the most recent developments. These last investigations concern the direct contact condensation, stratification model, wall friction, droplet break up and the scale effect, geometrical effect and pressure effect on interfacial friction. ?? 1990.},

Our sensitivity methodology relies on the non-intrusive approach of the generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) method; the gPC is a spectral non-statistical numerical method well-suited to representing random processes not restricted to Gaussian fields. The analysis is carried out at Re$\lambda$=100 and for different grid resolutions and Cs distributions. Numerical predictions are also compared to direct numerical simulation evidence. We have shown that the different turbulent scales of the LES solution respond differently to the variability in Cs. In particular, the study of the relative turbulent kinetic energy distributions for different Cs distributions indicates that small scales are mainly affected by changes in the subgrid-model parametric uncertainty.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm to model the input uncertainty and its propagation in incompressible flow simulations. The stochastic input is represented spectrally by employing orthogonal polynomial functionals from the Askey scheme as trial basis to represent the random space. A standard Galerkin projection is applied in the random dimension to obtain the equations in the weak form. The resulting system of deterministic equations is then solved with standard methods to obtain the solution for each random mode. This approach can be considered as a generalization of the original polynomial chaos expansion, first introduced by Wiener [Am. J. Math. 60 (1938) 897]. The original method employs the Hermite polynomials (one of the 13 members of the Askey scheme) as the basis in random space. The algorithm is applied to micro-channel flows with random wall boundary conditions, and to external flows with random freestream. Efficiency and convergence are studied by comparing with exact solutions as well as numerical solutions obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the generalized polynomial chaos method promises a substantial speed-up compared with the Monte Carlo method. The utilization of different type orthogonal polynomials from the Askey scheme also provides a more efficient way to represent general non-Gaussian processes compared with the original Wiener-Hermite expansions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a transient roll-wave simulator based on a one-dimensional incompressible two-fluid model. Using an efficient numerical method and a grid cell length of one pipe diameter, the simulator is able to accurately predict experimental data in the roll-wave regime. Essential to obtaining the stable roll-wave solutions is the use of a modified version of the Biberg friction model. Based on an algebraic eddy viscosity model, the Biberg model yields mechanistic expressions for the wall and interfacial shear stresses in stratified two-phase flow. Input to the model is closure relations for the turbulence levels at either side of the interface. In order to model the increased dissipation of energy in breaking wave fronts, we propose to modify the original closures by adding a term proportional to the negative gradient of the liquid height. As the waves grow and come close to breaking, this term redistributes the shear stresses such that the waves are stabilized. The numerical method used in the simulator is an extension of a previously presented pseudospectral Fourier method. In particular, spectral vanishing viscosity terms are introduced to stabilize short wavelengths inconsistent with the long wavelength approximation of the two-fluid model. The result is a simulator that provides reliable and convergent numerical solutions for all stratified flow conditions. In the last part of the paper, the simulator is tested against roll-wave experiments with horizontal and upward inclined flows of water and a dense gas in a 10 cm pipe. Wave heights and speeds as well as mean pressure drops and holdups are predicted within 20{\%} accuracy when compared with 474 experiments. Furthermore, the transient simulations enable us to study the dynamics and interactions between waves. In agreement with experimental observations, two different wave growth mechanisms are identified, and their influence on the evolution of the roll-wave flow regime is analyzed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There are difficulties with probability as a representation of uncertainty. However, we argue that there is an important distinction between principle and practice. In principle, probability is uniquely appropriate for the representation and quantification of all forms of uncertainty; it is in this sense that we claim that 'probability is perfect'. In practice, people find it difficult to express their knowledge and beliefs in probabilistic form, so that elicitation of probability distributions is a far from perfect process. We therefore argue that there is no need for alternative theories, but that any practical elicitation of expert knowledge must fully acknowledge imprecision in the resulting distribution. We outline a recently developed Bayesian technique that allows the imprecision in elicitation to be formulated explicitly, and apply it to some of the challenge problems. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index.

abstract = {{\{}{\textless}{\}}p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}Given a wind-farm with known dimensions and number of wind-turbines, we try to find the optimum positioning of wind-turbines that maximises wind-farm energy production. In practise, given that optimisation has to be performed for many wind directions and taking into account the yearly wind distribution, such an optimisation is computationally only feasible using fast engineering wake models such as, e.g., the Jensen model. These models are known to have accuracy issues, in particular since their representation of wake interaction is very simple. In the present work, we propose an optimisation approach that is based on a hybrid combination of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and the Jensen model, in which optimisation is mainly performed using the Jensen model, and LES is used at a few points only during optimisation for online tuning of the wake-expansion coefficient in the Jensen model, and for validation of the results. An optimisation case study is considered, in which the placement of 30 turbines in a 4 by 3 km rectangular domain is optimised in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Both optimisation for single wind direction, and multiple wind directions are discussed.{\{}{\textless}{\}}/p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}},

The stochastic model is subsequently used to assess the effect of the uncertainty in airfoil static lift and drag coefficients on the prediction of extreme loads and structural reliability of large wind turbines. It is shown that the uncertainty in the static airfoil data has a significant impact on the prediction of extreme loads effects and structural reliability depending on the component, operating conditions (stand-still versus power production) and the correlations of aerodynamic variables along the span of the blades.},

The asymptotic analysis identifies the acoustic time change of the heat-release rate as the dominant source of sound in {\{}{\{}{\}}low-Mach{\{}{\}}{\}}-number flow. The viscous and buoyancy forces enter the computation of the second-order 'incompressible' pressure in {\{}{\{}{\}}low-Mach{\{}{\}}{\}}-number flow in a similar way as they enter the pressure computation in incompressible flow, except for a nonzero velocity-divergence constraint. If the flow equations are averaged over an acoustic wave period, the averaged velocity tensor describes the net acoustic effect on the averaged flow field. Removing acoustics from the equations altogether leads to the {\{}{\{}{\}}low-Mach{\{}{\}}{\}}-number equations, which allow for large temperature and density changes as opposed to the Boussinesq equations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we apply Bayesian uncertainty quantification techniques to the processes of calibrating complex mathematical models and predicting quantities of interest (QoI's) with such models. These techniques also enable the systematic comparison of competing model classes. The processes of calibration and comparison constitute the building blocks of a larger validation process, the goal of which is to accept or reject a given mathematical model for the prediction of a particular QoI for a particular scenario. In this work, we take the first step in this process by applying the methodology to the analysis of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model in the context of incompressible, boundary layer flows. Three competing model classes based on the Spalart–Allmaras model are formulated, calibrated against experimental data, and used to issue a prediction with quantified uncertainty. The model classes are compared in terms of their posterior probabilities and their prediction of QoI's. The model posterior probability represents the relative plausibility of a model class given the data. Thus, it incorporates the model's ability to fit experimental observations. Alternatively, comparing models using the predicted QoI connects the process to the needs of decision makers that use the results of the model. We show that by using both the model plausibility and predicted QoI, one has the opportunity to reject some model classes after calibration, before subjecting the remaining classes to additional validation challenges.},

@article{Bartl2016,
abstract = {{\{}{\textless}{\}}p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}This is a summary of the results of the fourth Blind test workshop which was held in Trondheim in October 2015. Herein, computational predictions on the performance of two in-line model wind turbines as well as the mean and turbulent wake flow are compared to experimental data measured at NTNU's wind tunnel. A detailed description of the model geometry, the wind tunnel boundary conditions and the test case specifications was published before the workshop. Expert groups within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were invited to submit predictions on wind turbine performance and wake flow without knowing the experimental results at the outset. The focus of this blind test comparison is to examine the model turbines' performance and wake development up until 9 rotor diameters downstream at three different atmospheric inflow conditions. Besides a spatially uniform inflow field of very low turbulence intensity (TI{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;={\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;0.23{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;{\{}{\%}{\}}) as well as high turbulence intensity (TI{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;={\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;10.0{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;{\{}{\%}{\}}), the turbines are exposed to a grid-generated atmospheric shear flow (TI{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;={\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;10.1{\{}{\&}{\}}thinsp;{\{}{\%}{\}}). {\{}{\textless}{\}}br{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}{\{}{\textless}{\}}br{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Five different research groups contributed with their predictions using a variety of simulation models, ranging from fully resolved Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models to Large Eddy Simulations (LES). For the three inlet conditions the power and the thrust force of the upstream turbine is predicted fairly well by most models, while the predictions of the downstream turbine's performance show a significantly higher scatter. Comparing the mean velocity profiles in the wake, most models approximate the mean velocity deficit level sufficiently well. However, larger variations between the models for higher downstream positions are observed. The prediction of the turbulence kinetic energy in the wake is observed to be very challenging. Both the LES model and the IDDES (Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) model, however, are consistently managing to provide fairly accurate predictions of the wake turbulence.{\{}{\textless}{\}}/p{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}},

abstract = {We present an efficient numerical strategy for the Bayesian solution of inverse problems. Stochastic collocation methods, based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solution over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a surrogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal computational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior. The numerical strategy and the predicted convergence rates are then demonstrated on nonlinear inverse problems of varying smoothness and dimension. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 Global-Science Press.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new and accurate method for modeling dynamic and transient behaviors of slug initiation and growth in horizontal ducts. In this analysis, a hyperbolic, two-pressure, five-equation, two-fluid model predicted the dynamic behavior of a complicated slug flow regime. The model was modified by including friction with the wall and at the interfaces between phases. In this paper, highly accurate shock capturing numerical methods were applied to slug modeling for the first time. The applied method is low cost, simple and does not exhibit the problems of previous numerical methods, such as the high computational time associated with the finite volume of two-fluid models. The new method does not use experimental correlations and assumptions to simplify the model like unit cell and slug tracking methods. In the present work, the numerical method of AUSMDV was used for a one-dimensional, two-pressure, five-equation, hyperbolic, two-fluid model. The calculation is conducted by applying second order time and space accuracy. The AUSMDV numerical method does not identify a complicated matrix solution; therefore, it renders the flow field solution using minimal computational resources. Discretization of non-conservative products that appear in the momentum equations was performed using a conservative linear path scheme (based on path conservative schemes by Pares), and accurate discretization of non-conservative terms based on AUSM fluxes have been conducted. Numerical solutions are presented for well-defined problems of two-phase, gas-liquid flows. The well-defined test cases that were considered for verification and validation are the Reiman Shock Tube and the Ransom Water Faucet. Numerical estimates of slug flows in horizontal ducts were compared with two sets of experimental results. Good agreement between modeled and experimental results, as well as a grid independency study, suggests that the presented model is capable of slug tracking and slug capturing. In addition, the numerical method that is used here can predict flows with sufficient accuracy. Finally, several facts related to the physics of slug behavior were outlined. These facts could be useful for scientists who wish to model the flow regime correctly, and they may be important for system designers who must predict slug behavior physically. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

With simplifications, such as massless gas phase and no wall and interfacial frictions, analytical solutions had been previously obtained for the transient liquid velocity and void fraction distribution. The water faucet problem and its analytical solutions have been widely used for code assessment, benchmark, and numerical verification. In this work, we present a new set of analytical solutions to the water faucet problem at the steady-state condition, with the gas-phase density's effect on pressure distribution considered. This new set of analytical solutions is used in a rigorous numerical verification process from which the anticipated second-order spatial accuracy is achieved for a second-order spatial discretization scheme. On the contrary, the same anticipated order of accuracy could not be obtained using the Ransom solutions as the reference. In addition, extended Ransom transient solutions for the gas-phase velocity and pressure are derived with the assumption of decoupled liquid and gas pressures. Numerical benchmark on the extended Ransom solutions is also presented.},

Leja sequences are arbitrarily granular (any number of nodes may be added to a current sequence, producing a new sequence) and thus are a good choice for the univariate composite rule used to construct adaptive sparse grids in high dimensions. When undertaking stochastic collocation one is often interested in constructing weighted approximation where the weights are determined by the probability densities of the random variables. This paper establishes that a certain weighted formulation of one-dimensional Leja sequences produces a sequence of nodes whose empirical distribution converges to the corresponding limiting distribution of the Gauss quadrature nodes associated with the weight function. This property is true even for unbounded domains. We apply the Leja-sparse grid approach to several high-dimensional and problems and demonstrate that Leja sequences are often superior to more standard sparse grid constructions (e.g. Clenshaw-Curtis), at least for interpolatory metrics.},

Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.

abstract = {Recent theoretical progress indicates that spacetime and gravity emerge $\backslash$break together from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory. These{\~{}}ideas are best understood in Anti-de Sitter space, where they rely{\~{}}on{\~{}}the area law for entanglement entropy. The extension to de Sitter space requires taking into account the entropy and temperature associated with the cosmological horizon. Using insights from string theory, black hole physics and quantum information theory we argue that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal volume law contribution to the entropy that overtakes the area law precisely at the cosmological horizon. Due to the competition between area and volume law entanglement the microscopic de Sitter states do not thermalise at sub-Hubble scales: they exhibit memory effects in the form of an entropy displacement caused by matter. The emergent laws of gravity contain an additional `dark' gravitational force describing the `elastic' response due to the entropy displacement. We derive an estimate of the strength of this extra force in terms of the baryonic mass, Newton's constant and the Hubble acceleration scale {\$}a{\_}0 =cH{\_}0{\$}, and provide evidence for the fact that this additional `dark gravity{\~{}}force' explains the observed phenomena in galaxies and clusters currently attributed to dark{\~{}}matter.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {This paper offers a procedure for the estimation of the numerical uncertainty of any integral or local flow quantity as a result of a fluid flow computation; the procedure requires solutions on systematically refined grids. The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index. Examples of application of the procedure are included. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {As one of the most adopted sequential data assimilation methods in many areas, especially those involving complex nonlinear dynamics, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been under extensive investigation regarding its properties and efficiency. Compared to other variants of the Kalman filter (KF), EnKF is straightforward to implement, as it employs random ensembles to represent solution states. This, however, introduces sampling errors that affect the accuracy of EnKF in a negative manner. Though sampling errors can be easily reduced by using a large number of samples, in practice this is undesirable as each ensemble member is a solution of the system of state equations and can be time consuming to compute for large-scale problems. In this paper we present an efficient EnKF implementation via generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion. The key ingredients of the proposed approach involve (1) solving the system of stochastic state equations via the gPC methodology to gain efficiency; and (2) sampling the gPC approximation of the stochastic solution with an arbitrarily large number of samples, at virtually no additional computational cost, to drastically reduce the sampling errors. The resulting algorithm thus achieves a high accuracy at reduced computational cost, compared to the classical implementations of EnKF. Numerical examples are provided to verify the convergence property and accuracy improvement of the new algorithm. We also prove that for linear systems with Gaussian noise, the first-order gPC Kalman filter method is equivalent to the exact Kalman filter. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The violent motion (sloshing) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in cargo tanks has attracted significant attention. Transformations of the LNG market have led to the increased transport of LNG in partially filled tanks, but established technology is mainly based on engineering experience with completely filled containers. This paper investigates a large sample of sloshing pressure measurements. It focuses on the magnitude of individual sloshing impact events, and their associated temporal and spatial patterns. The durations of these impacts are comparable to the natural frequency of an LNG container wall, so the details of their time histories are important in determining the structural response. Experiments are performed on tanks with high (92.5{\%}) and low (30{\%}) filling levels, for various wave headings. The common post-processing approach of representing impact pressure histories by a triangular profile is studied, and an alternative approach is presented. Two statistical models are used to describe the distribution of maximal pressures in sloshing impacts: a three-parameter Weibull model and a generalized Pareto model. The latter is found to be of questionable utility due to small sample sizes. It is observed that for low filling levels the sloshing impacts are of greater magnitude, having longer durations, smaller ratios of rise time to duration, and larger spatial extents. All these factors should in principle increase the structural response. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a popular test for code verification. To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the literature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with increasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and severely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test problem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the accuracy of their simulations based on ad-hoc proxies, e.g., the existence of small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed Kelvin-Helmholtz problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. We show that in many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in Kelvin-Helmholtz problems. We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution using both Athena, a Godunov code, and Dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code. Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump (which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behavior and are more computationally challenging. In the latter case, Athena simulations are prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as resolution increases. Both Athena and Dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we include the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in this paper in machine-readable form.},

Spectral stochastic methods are probabilistic in nature, and are consequently rooted in the rich mathematical foundations associated with probability and measure spaces. A brief discussion is provided of only those theoretical aspects needed to set the stage for subsequent applications. These are demonstrated through detailed treatments of elementary problems, as well as in more elaborate examples involving vortex-dominated flows and compressible flows at low Mach numbers. Some recent developments are also outlined in the book, including iterative techniques (such as stochastic multigrids and Newton schemes), intrusive and non-intrusive formalisms, spectral representations using mixed and discontinuous bases, multi-resolution approximations, and adaptive techniques. Readers are assumed to be familiar with elementary methods for the numerical solution of time-dependent, partial differential equations; prior experience with spectral approximation is helpful but not essential.},

abstract = {Understanding the local behavior of sloshing pressure is essential for the design of LNG containment systems, particularly for operations in offshore environments. Extensive sloshing experiments have revealed that local pressures at temporal resolution on the order of 20 kHz and spatial resolution of 5 mm for scaled models up to 1:20 are stochastic; peak pressure varies dramatically from cycle to cycle even under a simple harmonic excitation in 1 degree of freedom. In addition, such pressures are strong functions of local geometry such as corrugations and raised invar edges, as well as physical and thermal conditions of the ullage. As such, the phenomenon is very challenging for predictions using existing numerical algorithms. To obtain proper design values for the containment system, scaled model tests must address the above parameters and appropriate scaling laws must be identified. In this paper, we assimilate fundamental aspects of sloshing from first principles to identify relevant dimensionless numbers necessary for the dynamic similarity of scaled model tests involving local pressures. Various experiments were carried out to support the relevance of such dimensionless numbers; this paper discusses experimental results and their implication in scaling. INTRODUCTIONImpulsive loads that resulted from body entry into fluids have been extensively studied from the turn of the 20th century. von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n (1929) and Wagner (1932) employed potential flow theory to study the 2-D cylinder and wedge entry problem, respectively, by neglecting the effects of gravity. (Fluid acceleration during impact is much larger than that of gravity). The potential function was assumed to be $\Phi$ = 0 at the mean free surface z = 0. This condition was subsequently relaxed by many in vestigators, noticeably Zhao and Faltinsen (1993) and Zhang, Yue and Tanizawa (1996). Solutions obtained from these techniques are deterministic, i.e. the same initial and boundary conditions always lead to the same solutions.},

abstract = {Two-phase flows in pipelines occur in a variety of processes in the nuclear, petroleum and gas industries. Because of the practical importance of accurately predicting steady and unsteady flows along the line, two-fluid models have been extensively used in numerical simulations. These models are usually written as a system of non-linear partial-differential equations. A reliable prediction of such flows is a difficult task to accomplish due to the numerous sources of uncertainties, such as the basic two-phase flow model, the flow-pattern models, the initial and boundary conditions and the numerical method used to solve the initial-boundary-value problem. Several numerical methods, conservative or not, may be used to discretize the problem. In this paper we analyze the global performance of the numerical model, obtained when we couple a classical one-dimensional single-pressure four-equation two-fluid model to a numerical discretization based on the flux-corrected transport (FCT) method, to solve the stratified-pattern two-phase flow that occurs in typical gas-gathering offshore pipelines. The gas phase is considered to be compressible and the liquid phase is incompressible, whereas the flow is assumed to be isothermal. We show that the FCT method is second-order in space and that our numerical kernel produces accurate simulations for steady, as well as unsteady, simulations. We also analyze the hyperbolicity property of the two-fluid model and the adequate prescription of the boundary conditions. The results show that hyperbolicity is lost in part of the area of the stratified-pattern region of a classical flow-pattern diagram. Moreover, the eigenvalues alternate signs at the boundaries, which has implications on how to impose the boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of typical offshore gas pipeline flows show very good agreement when compared to a commercial software.},

abstract = {We present an efficient numerical strategy for the Bayesian solution of in-verse problems. Stochastic collocation methods, based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solu-tion over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a sur-rogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal com-putational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associ-ated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approx-imate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields sim-ilarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior. The numerical strategy and the predicted convergence rates are then demonstrated on nonlinear inverse problems of varying smoothness and dimension.},

abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

@article{Cheung2011a,
abstract = {In this paper, we apply Bayesian uncertainty quantification techniques to the processes of calibrating complex mathematical models and predicting quantities of interest (QoI's) with such models. These techniques also enable the systematic comparison of competing model classes. The processes of calibration and comparison constitute the building blocks of a larger validation process, the goal of which is to accept or reject a given mathematical model for the prediction of a particular QoI for a particular scenario. In this work, we take the first step in this process by applying the methodology to the analysis of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model in the context of incompressible, boundary layer flows. Three competing model classes based on the Spalart–Allmaras model are formulated, calibrated against experimental data, and used to issue a prediction with quantified uncertainty. The model classes are compared in terms of their posterior probabilities and their prediction of QoI's. The model posterior probability represents the relative plausibility of a model class given the data. Thus, it incorporates the model's ability to fit experimental observations. Alternatively, comparing models using the predicted QoI connects the process to the needs of decision makers that use the results of the model. We show that by using both the model plausibility and predicted QoI, one has the opportunity to reject some model classes after calibration, before subjecting the remaining classes to additional validation challenges.},

Numerical accuracy and stability on locally refined nested Cartesian grids are achieved using a finite-volume discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on higher-order conservation principles – i.e., in addition to mass and momentum conservation, kinetic energy conservation in the inviscid limit is used to guide the selection of the discrete operators and solution algorithms. Hanging nodes at the interface are virtually slanted to improve the pressure-velocity projection, while the other parts of the grid maintain an orthogonal Cartesian grid topology. The present method is straight-forward to implement and shows superior conservation of mass, momentum, and kinetic energy compared to the conventional methods employing interpolation at the interface between coarse and fine grids.},

Herein, computational predictions on the performance of two in-line model wind turbines as well as the mean and turbulent wake flow are compared to experimental data measured at NTNU's wind tunnel. A detailed description of the model geometry, the wind tunnel boundary conditions and the test case specifications was published before the workshop. Expert groups within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were invited to submit predictions on wind turbine performance and wake flow without knowing the experimental results at the outset. The focus of this blind test comparison is to examine the model turbines' performance and wake development up until 9 rotor diameters downstream at three different atmospheric inflow conditions. Besides a spatially uniform inflow field of very low turbulence intensity (TI{\&}thinsp;={\&}thinsp;0.23{\&}thinsp;{\%}) as well as high turbulence intensity (TI{\&}thinsp;={\&}thinsp;10.0{\&}thinsp;{\%}), the turbines are exposed to a grid-generated atmospheric shear flow (TI{\&}thinsp;={\&}thinsp;10.1{\&}thinsp;{\%}). {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Five different research groups contributed with their predictions using a variety of simulation models, ranging from fully resolved Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models to Large Eddy Simulations (LES). For the three inlet conditions the power and the thrust force of the upstream turbine is predicted fairly well by most models, while the predictions of the downstream turbine's performance show a significantly higher scatter. Comparing the mean velocity profiles in the wake, most models approximate the mean velocity deficit level sufficiently well. However, larger variations between the models for higher downstream positions are observed. The prediction of the turbulence kinetic energy in the wake is observed to be very challenging. Both the LES model and the IDDES (Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation) model, however, are consistently managing to provide fairly accurate predictions of the wake turbulence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Particle deposition is a complex problem in oil fields which affects all aspects of petroleum production, processing, and transportation. Asphaltene deposition has been repeatedly reported in various oil fields with interest on how it impacts the development of a reservoir. In many of the reported cases, it has been indicated that asphaltene deposition damages the wellbore and production facilities more severely than the formation. A great deal of research has been conducted to study the phase behavior and dynamic aspect of asphaltene deposition. However, there is a lack of comprehensive integrated modeling of asphaltene deposition in the wellbore during the multiphase fluid flow. In this paper, we present an implementation of asphaltene precipitation and deposition models into a thermal, multiphase, multi-component wellbore simulator that can be coupled with a compositional reservoir simulator. A key contribution of this work is the development of a simulator for predicting the detrimental effects of asphaltene in a well. Simulation results can show where and when the presence of asphaltene particles severely damages the efficiency and the productivity of the wells. This prediction is highly crucial if it is aimed to control the well performance and to optimize productivity.},

abstract = {Two-phase flow occurs during the production of oil and gas in the wellbores. Modeling this phenomenon is important for monitoring well productivity and designing surface facilities. Since transient time period in the producing well is usually shorter than reservoir time steps, stabilized flow is assumed in the wellbore. As such, semi-steady state models are used for modeling wellbore dynamics. However, in the case that flow variations occur in a short period of time (i.e., gas kick during drilling) the use of a transient two-phase model is crucial. A great deal of research has been conducted to study transient two-phase flow in wellbores. However, there is lack of a comprehensive two-fluid model in the petroleum literature. In this paper, we present an implementation of a pseudocompositional, thermal, fully implicit, transient two-fluid model for two-phase flow in wellbores. In this model, we solve gas/liquid mass balance, gas/liquid momentum balance, and two-phase energy balance equations to obtain five primary variables: liquid velocity, gas velocity, pressure, holdup, and temperature. This simulator can be used as a stand-alone code or can be used in conjunction with a reservoir simulator to mimic wellbore/reservoir dynamic interactions. In our model, we consider stratified, bubbly, intermittent and annular flow regimes using appropriate closure relations for inter-phase and wall shear stress terms in the momentum equations. In our simulation, we found that the inter-phase and wall shear stress terms for different flow regimes can significantly affect the model's results. In addition, the inter-phase momentum transfer terms mainly influence the holdup value. The outcome of this research leads to a more accurate simulation of multiphase flow in the wellbore and pipes, which can be applied to the surface facility design, well performance optimization, and wellbore damage estimation.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t This paper introduces a multidomain-staggered technique for coupling multiphase flow in a porous medium, dominated by the Darcy laminar flow, with multiphase flow in a wellbore, dominated by the Navier Stokes viscous, compressible flow. The Darcy flow in the porous medium is formulated using the averaging theory, and the Navier Stokes flow in the wellbore is formulated using the drift-flux model. The governing equations are discretized using a mixed discretization finite element scheme, in which the partition of unity finite element method, the level set method and the standard Galerkin finite element method are combined in an integrated numerical scheme. A multidomain technique is utilized to uncouple the physical system into two subdomains, coupled back by enforcing flow constraints at their interaction boundaries. The resulting system of equations is solved using an iterative staggered technique and a multiple time-stepping scheme. This combination between the multidomain technique and the staggered-multiple time-stepping technique enables the use of different mathematical and numerical formulations for the two subdomains, and facilitates the implementation of a standard finite element computer code. The proposed model is tailored to simulate sequestered CO 2 leakage through hetero-geneous geological formation layers and abandoned wellbores. A numerical example describing different leakage scenarios is given to demonstrate the computational capability of the model. The numerical results are compared to those obtained from a commercial simulator.},

@article{Margheri2016,
abstract = {To significantly increase the contribution of numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for risk assessment and decision making, it is important to quantitatively measure the impact of uncertainties to assess the reliability and robustness of the results. As unsteady high-fidelity CFD simulations are becoming the standard for industrial applications, reducing the number of required samples to perform sensitivity (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis is an actual engineering challenge. The novel approach presented in this paper is based on an efficient hybridization between the anchored-ANOVA and the POD/Kriging methods, which have already been used in CFD-UQ realistic applications, and the definition of best practices to achieve global accuracy. The anchored-ANOVA method is used to efficiently reduce the UQ dimension space, while the POD/Kriging is used to smooth and interpolate each anchored-ANOVA term. The main advantages of the proposed method are illustrated through four applications with increasing complexity, most of them based on Large-Eddy Simulation as a high-fidelity CFD tool: the turbulent channel flow, the flow around an isolated bluff-body, a pedestrian wind comfort study in a full scale urban area and an application to toxic gas dispersion in a full scale city area. The proposed c-APK method (anchored-ANOVA-POD/Kriging) inherits the advantages of each key element: interpolation through POD/Kriging precludes the use of quadrature schemes therefore allowing for a more flexible sampling strategy while the ANOVA decomposition allows for a better domain exploration. A comparison of the three methods is given for each application. In addition, the importance of adding flexibility to the control parameters and the choice of the quantity of interest (QoI) are discussed. As a result, global accuracy can be achieved with a reasonable number of samples allowing computationally expensive CFD-UQ analysis.},

@book{Horn2013,
abstract = {Preface to the Second Edition The basic structure of the first edition has been preserved in the second because it remains congruent with the goal of writing “a book that would be a useful modern treatment of a broad range of topics...[that] may be used as an undergraduate or graduate text and as a self-contained reference for a variety of audiences.” The quotation is from the Preface to the First Edition, whose declaration of goals for thework remains unchanged. What is different in the second edition? The core role of canonical forms has been expanded as a unifying element in understanding similarity (complex, real, and simultaneous), unitary equivalence, uni- tary similarity, congruence, *congruence, unitary congruence, triangular equivalence, and other equivalence relations. More attention is paid to cases of equality in the many inequalities considered in the book. Block matrices are a ubiquitous feature of the exposition in the new edition. Learning mathematics has never been a spectator sport, so the newedition continues to emphasize the value of exercises and problems for the active reader. Numerous 2-by-2 examples illustrate concepts throughout the book. Problem threads (some span several chapters) develop special topics as the foundation for them evolves in the text. For example, there are threads involving the adjugate matrix, the compound matrix, finite-dimensional quantum systems, the Loewner ellipsoid and the Loewner–John matrix, and normalizable matrices; see the index for page references for these threads. The first edition had about 690 problems; the second edition has more than 1,100. Many problems have hints; they may be found in an appendix that appears just before the index. A comprehensive index is essential for a book that is intended for sustained use as a reference after initial use as a text. The index to the first edition had about 1,200 entries; the current index has more than 3,500 entries. An unfamiliar term encountered in the text should be looked up in the index, where a pointer to a definition (in Chapter 0 or elsewhere) is likely to be found. New discoveries since 1985 have shaped the presentation of many topics and have stimulated inclusion of some new ones. A few examples of the latter are the Jordan canonical form of a rank-one perturbation, motivated by enduring student interest in the Google matrix; a generalization of real normal matrices (normal matrices A such that A ¯ A is real); computable block matrix criteria for simultaneous unitary similarity or simultaneous unitary congruence; G. Belitskii's discovery that a matrix commutes with a Weyr canonical form if and only if it is block upper triangular and has a special structure; the discovery by K. C. O'Meara and C. Vinsonhaler that, unlike the corresponding situation for the Jordan canonical form, a commuting family can be simultaneously upper triangularized by similarity in such a way that any one specified matrix in the family is in Weyr canonical form; and canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence. Queries from many readers have motivated changes in the way that some topics are presented. For example, discussion of Lidskii's eigenvalue majorization inequalities was moved from a section primarily devoted to singular value inequalities to the section where majorization is discussed. Fortunately, a splendid new proof of Lidskii's inequalities by C. K. Li and R. Mathias became available and was perfectly aligned with Chapter 4's new approach to eigenvalue inequalities for Hermitian matrices. A second example is a new proof of Birkhoff's theorem, which has a very different flavor from the proof in the first edition. Instructors accustomed to the order of topics in the first edition may be interested in a chapter-by-chapter summary of what is different in the new edition: 0. Chapter 0 has been expanded by about 75{\%} to include a more comprehensive summary of useful concepts and facts. It is intended to serve as an as-needed reference. Definitions of terms and notations used throughout the book can be found here, but it has no exercises or problems. Formal courses and reading for self-study typically begin with Chapter 1. 1. Chapter 1 contains new examples related to similarity and the characteristic poly- nomial, as well as an enhanced emphasis on the role of left eigenvectors in matrix analysis. 2. Chapter 2 contains a detailed presentation of real orthogonal similarity, an exposition of McCoy's theorem on simultaneous triangularization, and a rigor- ous treatment of continuity of eigenvalues that makes essential use of both the unitary and triangular aspects of Schur's unitary triangularization theorem. Sec- tion 2.4 (Consequences of Schur's triangularization theorem) is almost twice the length of the corresponding section in the first edition. There are two newsections, one devoted to the singular value decomposition and one devoted to the CS de- composition. Early introduction of the singular value decomposition permits this essential tool of matrix analysis to be used throughout the rest of the book. 3. Chapter 3 approaches the Jordan canonical form via the Weyr characteristic; it contains an exposition of the Weyr canonical form and its unitary variant that were not in the first edition. Section 3.2 (Consequences of the Jordan canonical form) discusses many new applications; it contains 60{\%} more material than the corresponding section in the first edition. 4. Chapter 4 now has a modern presentation of variational principles and eigen- value inequalities for Hermitian matrices via subspace intersections. It contains an expanded treatment of inverse problems associated with interlacing and other classical results. Its detailed treatment of unitary congruence includes Youla's theorem (a normal form for a square complex matrix A under unitary congruence that is associated with the eigenstructure of A ¯ A), as well as canonical forms for conjugate normal, congruence normal, and squared normal matrices. It also has an exposition of recently discovered canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence and new algorithms to construct a basis of a coneigenspace. 5. Chapter 5 contains an expanded discussion of norm duality, many new problems, and a treatment of semi-inner products that finds application in a discussion of finite-dimensional quantum systems in Chapter 7. 6. Chapter 6 has a newtreatment of the “disjoint discs” aspect of Gerˇ sgorin's theorem and a reorganized discussion of eigenvalue perturbations, including differentiabil- ity of a simple eigenvalue. 7. Chapter 7 has been reorganized now that the singular value decomposition is introduced in Chapter 2. There is a newtreatment of the polar decomposition, new factorizations related to the singular value decomposition, and special emphasis on rowand column inclusion. The von Neumann trace theorem (proved via Birkhoff's theorem) is now the foundation on which many applications of the singular value decomposition are built. The Loewner partial order and block matrices are treated in detail with new techniques, as are the classical determinant inequalities for positive definite matrices. 8. Chapter 8 uses facts about left eigenvectors developed in Chapter 1 to streamline its exposition of the Perron–Frobenius theory of positive and nonnegative matrices. D. Appendix D contains new explicit perturbation bounds for the zeroes of a poly- nomial and the eigenvalues of a matrix. F. Appendix F tabulates a modern list of canonical forms for a pair of Hermitian matrices, or a pair of matrices, one of which is symmetric and the other is skew symmetric. These canonical pairs are applications of the canonical forms for congruence and ∗congruence presented in Chapter 4. Readers who are curious about the technology of book making may be interested to know that this book began as a set of L ATEX files created manually by a company in India from hard copy of the first edition. Those files were edited and revised using the ScientificWorkPlace R ?graphical user interface and typesetting system. The cover art for the second edition was the result of a lucky encounter on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles in spring 2003. The young man in the middle seat said he was an artist who paints abstract paintings that are sometimes mathematically inspired. In the course of friendly conversation, he revealed that his special area of mathematical enjoyment was linear algebra, and that he had studied Matrix Analysis. After mutual expressions of surprise at the chance nature of our meeting, and a pleasant discussion, we agreed that appropriate cover artwould enhance the visual appeal of the second edition; he said he would send something to consider. In due course a packet arrived from Seattle. It contained a letter and a stunning 4.5- by 5-inch color photograph, identified on the back as an image of a 72- by 66-inch oil on canvas, painted in 2002. The letter said that “the painting is entitled Surprised Again on the Diagonal and is inspired by the recurring prevalence of the diagonal in math whether it be in geometry, analysis, algebra, set theory or logic. I think that it would be an attractive addition to your wonderful book.” Thank you, Lun-Yi Tsai, for your wonderful cover art!

The author focuses on elliptic equations and systematically develops the relevant existence schemes, always with a view towards nonlinear problems. These are maximum principle methods (particularly important for numerical analysis schemes), parabolic equations, variational methods, and continuity methods. This book also develops the main methods for obtaining estimates for solutions of elliptic equations: Sobolev space theory, weak and strong solutions, Schauder estimates, and Moser iteration. Connections between elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations are explored, as well as the connection with Brownian motion and semigroups.

abstract = {The three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations are time-reversible. This property should be preserved as well as possible by numerical discretizations. This article investigates the time-reversibility properties of various solvers designed for incompressible Navier-Stokes computations. The test case is the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex, which becomes "turbulent" before the time is reversed to try to recover the initial condition. The simulations are performed using high and low order finite difference solvers as well as using a pseudo-spectral solver. Various time-stepping schemes are also investigated. Although the flow statistics are significantly affected by the accuracy of the space discretization, the time-reversibility is not because most space-discretizations are time-reversible for an exact time-stepping. The crucial factor for time-reversibility is the accuracy of the time-stepping scheme and its interaction with the space-discretization. Furthermore, an important practical requirement for the solver is to be energy conserving in order to avoid numerical instability. An energy conserving solver using an accurate time-stepping is then able to go back almost perfectly from a complex "turbulent" flow to the simple initial condition. Therefore, we propose that this constitutes a severe and useful benchmark that Navier-Stokes solvers should challenge. The present investigations and their conclusions are also supported by parallel 1-D investigations, using the non-linear convection equation (inviscid Burgers) and the linear convection equation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Data assimilation is the process by which observational data are fused with scientific information. The Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent probabilistic approach for combining information, and thus is an appropriate framework for data assimilation. Viewing data assimilation as a problem in Bayesian statistics is not new. However, the field of Bayesian statistics is rapidly evolving and new approaches for model construction and sampling have been utilized recently in a wide variety of disciplines to combine information. This article includes a brief introduction to Bayesian methods. Paying particular attention to data assimilation, we review linkages to optimal interpolation, kriging, Kalman filtering, smoothing, and variational analysis. Discussion is provided concerning Monte Carlo methods for implementing Bayesian analysis, including importance sampling, particle filtering, ensemble Kalman filtering, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, hierarchical Bayesian modeling is reviewed. We indicate how this approach can be used to incorporate significant physically based prior information into statistical models, thereby accounting for uncertainty. The approach is illustrated in a simplified advection–diffusion model.},

abstract = {Abstract Liquid loading is a serious problem in areas where gas fields are maturing. An analysis is provided of the production behaviour over time of liquid-loaded wells. This shows clearly that these wells can operate at two different rates, a stable rate at which full production is taking place and a lower metastable rate at which liquid loading effects play a role. A model has been constructed which enhances the understanding of the process of water build up and drainage in gas wells. It assumes a single gas and water co-production point and a single water re-injection point. As expected a water column is built up in the well as soon as production takes place below the critical rate. As observed in the field, for good inflow performance a metastable flowrate can be observed. At this state the water re-injection and water co-production rate are equal to one another and the water column height stabilizes. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine how well parameters influence the metastable flowrate, the time required to reach this metastable rate, the corresponding water column height and the shut-in time required to drain this water column. The results of the analysis indicate that significant metastable flow rates occur in wells which have good inflow performance, a low water gas ratio and a large distance between injection and production point. Furthermore a steady state analytical solution has been derived for the metastable rate and stabilized water column height confirming the numerical analysis results},

abstract = {Drift-flux modeling techniques are commonly used to represent two- and three-phase flow in pipes and wellbores. Unlike mechanistic models, drift-flux models are continuous, differentiable, and relatively fast to compute, so they are well suited for use in wellbore flow models within reservoir simulators. Drift-flux models require a number of empirical parameters. Most of the parameters used in current simulators were determined from experiments in small-diameter (2 in. or less) pipes. These parameters may not be directly applicable to flow in wellbores or surface facilities, however, because the flow mechanisms in small pipes can differ qualitatively from those in large pipes. In order to evaluate and extend current drift-flux models, an extensive experimental program was initiated. The experiments entailed measurement of water/gas, oil/ water, and oil/water/gas flows in a 15-cm-diameter, 11-m-long plexiglass pipe at eight deviations ranging from vertical to slightly downward. In this paper, these experimental data are used to determine drift-flux parameters for steady-state two-phase flows of water/gas and oil/water in large-diameter pipes at inclinations ranging from vertical to near-horizontal. The parameters are determined using an optimization technique that minimizes the difference between experimental and model predictions for phase in-situ volume fraction. It is shown that the optimized parameters provide considerably better agreement with the experimental data than do the existing default parameters.},

abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the primary goal of the foundations of statistics is to provide data analysts with a set of guiding principles that are guaranteed to lead to valid statistical inference. This leads to two new questions: " what is valid statistical inference? " and " do existing methods achieve this? " Towards answering these questions, this paper makes three contributions. First, we express statistical inference as a process of converting observations into degrees of belief, and we give a clear mathematical definition of what it means for statistical inference to be valid. Second, we evaluate existing approaches Bayesian and frequentist approaches relative to this definition and conclude that, in general, these fail to provide valid statistical inference. This motivates a new way of thinking, and our third contribution is a demonstration that the inferential model framework meets the proposed criteria for valid and prior-free statistical inference, thereby solving perhaps the most important unsolved problem in statistics.},

abstract = {Summary A numerical fully implicit nonisothermal wellbore/reservoir simulator is developed. The model entails simultaneous solution of transient coupled mass-, momentum-, and energy-balance equations within the wellbore; energy-balance equations for the tubular and cement materials and the formation surrounding the wellbore; and mass-balance and flow-rate/pressure equations for the reservoir formation. A wellbore heat-loss model that is a strong feature of this study is developed and employed in the model to improve the accuracy of the simulator and to be able to estimate the casing temperature and formation-temperature distribution. The model formulation is completed with an equation of state (EOS) to estimate fluid properties and appropriate friction-factor correlations in the wellbore tubing to compute the frictional pressure drop for different flow regimes. The developed model has several applications in the petroleum industry, particularly in the gas-well testing design and interpretation of both isothermal and nonisothermal gas reservoirs. This nonisothermal simulator is validated through comparisons to both analytical models and an equivalent numerical isothermal coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator that is also developed in this paper. Applications of this simulator to analyzing gas-well testing problems, in addition to several important observations, are extensively studied in Part 2 of this research work (Bahonar et al. 2010). Currently, it has been well accepted that the applicability and significance of a reservoir simulator depend on the behaviour of the wellbore and interaction between the wellbore and reservoir. A robust, accurate coupled wellbore and reservoir simulator is an invaluable tool for the petroleum engineer to help the petroleum industry understand production behaviour, make a meaningful prediction, and make correct decisions in all field-development and production stages.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t At its most basic level, management of subsurface fluid resources involves a system comprising the wellbore and the target reservoir. As discrete pathways through geologic formations, boreholes and wells are critical to the success of many water, energy, and environmental management operations. Although many stand-alone simulators for two-phase flow in wellbores with various levels of sophistication have been developed, simulating non-isothermal, multiphase, and multi-component flows in both the wellbore and in the porous or fractured media reservoir as an integrated system remains a challenging yet important task. The difficulties include (1) different governing equations apply to the wellbore and the reservoir that need to be solved efficiently in a uniform framework, (2) the significant contrast in temporal and spatial scales between the wellbore and the reservoir that results in a very challenging set of stiff partial differential equations, and (3) other complexities (e.g., dry-out) that can be caused by flow processes between the wellbore and the reservoir. To address the need to simulate coupled wellbore– reservoir flow, we have developed T2Well, a numerical simulator for non-isothermal, multiphase, and multi-component flows in the integrated wellbore–reservoir system. The new model extends the existing numerical reservoir simulator TOUGH2 to calculate the flow in both the wellbore and the reservoir simultaneously and efficiently by introducing a special wellbore sub-domain into the numerical grid. For grid blocks in the wellbore sub-domain, we solve the 1D momentum equation of the mixture (which may be two-phase) as described by the drift-flux model (DFM). A novel mixed implicit–explicit scheme for friction in the wellbore is applied to facilitate the solution of the momentum equation, while other variables are calculated fully implicitly. Applications of the new simulator to problems in various fields are presented to demonstrate its capabilities. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a new model and a solution method for two-phase compressible flows. The model involves six equations obtained from conservation principles applied to each phase, completed by a seventh equation for the evolution of the volume fraction. This equation is necessary to close the overall system. The model is valid for fluid mixtures, as well as for pure fluids. The system of partial differential equations is hyperbolic. Hyperbolicity is obtained because each phase is considered to be compressible. Two difficulties arise for the solution: one of the equations is written in non-conservative form; non-conservative terms exist in the momentum and energy equations. We propose robust and accurate discretisation of these terms. The method solves the same system at each mesh point with the same algorithm. It allows the simulation of interface problems between pure fluids as well as multiphase mixtures. Several test cases where fluids have compressible behavior are shown as well as some other test problems where one of the phases is incompressible. The method provides reliable results, is able to compute strong shock waves, and deals with complex equations of state. c},

@article{Xiao2015,
abstract = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering application. For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, and has potential implications in many fields in which the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes. A notable example is climate modeling, where high-consequence decisions are made based on predictions (e.g., projected temperature rise) with major uncertainties originating from closure models that are used to account for unresolved or unknown physics including radiation, cloud, and boundary layer processes.},

A 24 km pipeline is predicted. The C O2 flow from the capture plant will fluctuate on a daily as well as hourly rate and sudden shut downs must be expected. Pipeline, wells and well completion must thus be designed such that a high level of fluctuation can be handled in the entire system.

A reservoir model is used for studying effects in the formation near the well bore and a flow simulator for the pipeline and well. Special emphasis is made on results related to transient pressure behavior in the bottom hole of the well. The results point towards that high loads as well as shut downs and shorter periods without flow can be handled by the modeled system. For long periods of very low rates of C O2 problems arise with keeping high C O2 saturation in the near well reservoir and with phase changes in the pipeline and well; thus the design of the system must be further investigated. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We study a two-phase pipe flow model with relaxation terms in the momentum and energy equations, driving the model towards dynamic and thermal equilibrium. These equilibrium states are characterized by the velocities and temperatures being equal in each phase. For each of these relaxation processes, we consider the limits of zero and infinite relaxation times. By expanding on previously established results, we derive a formulation of the mixture sound velocity for the thermally relaxed model. This allows us to directly prove a subcharacteristic condition; each level of equilibrium assumption imposed reduces the propagation velocity of pressure waves. Furthermore, we show that each relaxation procedure reduces the mixture sound velocity with a factor that is independent of whether the other relaxation procedure has already been performed. Numerical simulations indicate that thermal relaxation in the two-fluid model has negligible impact on mass transport dynamics. However, the velocity difference of sonic propagation in the thermally relaxed and unrelaxed two-fluid models may significantly affect practical simulations.},

abstract = {We perform finite-difference numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow in stationary and moving reference frames. The flow statistics computed in the stationary frame exhibit significant discrepancies with respect to reference spectral data in terms of energy spectra and convection velocity of disturbances, especially in the near-wall region. On the other hand, simulations performed in a reference frame moving with the bulk flow velocity suffer from this shortcoming to a much lesser extent. We propose an explanation of these observations by assuming the scalar Burgers' equation as working model. The analysis highlights the lack of Galilean invariance of finite-difference schemes, which exhibit a leading dispersive error in the presence of bulk advection. The numerically computed energy spectra exhibit the same features as the channel spectra, supporting the notion that dispersive effects are responsible for the blockage of the mechanism of energy cascade to high wavenumbers.},

His pioneering work has shown how to combine cost effective and relatively easy to implement, central, second-order accurate finite difference schemes with the appropriate variable discretization and time integration methods to efficiently solve complex turbulent flows. In this communication, we first compare the cost and accuracy of Fourier-spectral methods and second order finite difference discretization for the solution of a simple variable coefficient convection problem. We then extend our analysis to the inviscid Taylor Green vortex. We conclude with a discussion of related findings from the literature including the accuracy requirements for large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows.},

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

Our model involves a system of two partial differential equations in the form of viscous conservation laws, whose solutions may contain very sharp transitions. We show that a high-order/high resolution Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory scheme is an appropriate tool to discretize the buoyancy flux and obtain a well resolved representation of the solution of the model.

It has been found that more accurate predictions are obtained by taking hydrodynamic slugs into account. At low superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to overestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream gas expansion is suppressed by the hydrodynamic slugs. At relatively high superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to underestimate the severe slugging period.

Simulations with and without slug capturing are conducted to address the effect of hydrodynamic slugs on severe slugging. It has been found that more accurate predictions are obtained by taking hydrodynamic slugs into account. At low superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to overestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream gas expansion is suppressed by the hydrodynamic slugs. At relatively high superficial gas velocity, the simulation without slug capturing tends to underestimate the severe slugging period. When hydrodynamic slugs are captured, the upstream compressible volume is greatly enlarged by the blowout of the hydrodynamic slugs. In both situations, the influences of the hydrodynamic slugs can reduce the errors of the predicted severe slugging characteristics.},

@article{Donat2014,
abstract = {In this paper we provide a derivation of a 1D N-phase flow model in a porous medium under the condition of vertical equilibrium which generalizes the three-phase flow model developed in Guerrero et al. (2013). We identify, from a mathematical point of view, a set of conditions on the capillary pressures that ensure that the linearized, purely parabolic, initial value problem is well-posed. For the numerical simulation of the model, we advocate the use of Implicit-Explicit (IMEX)-Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes for time evolution with a Weighted-Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial discretization of the convective terms. In previous papers (Donat et al., 2013), (Guerrero et al., 2013), we showed that IMEX-RK methods can be useful in the numerical simulation of 1D two-phase and three-phase flows, since the stability restrictions for the time-step of these schemes are less severe than those of fully explicit schemes. On the other hand, their implementation requires, in general, a fairly intensive use of a nonlinear system solver, so that the efficiency and robustness of IMEX schemes for multi-phase flow is directly related to this nonlinear technique. In this paper we describe an efficient nonlinear system solver, based on an appropriate fixed-point iteration technique, in order to find the solution of the nonlinear systems that result from the implicit discretization of the nonlinear diffusive terms in the model. In addition, we implement zero-flux boundary conditions fully consistent with the vertical equilibrium assumptions. A set of numerical examples confirm the efficiency, robustness and reliability of the proposed numerical technique. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Realistic representation of stochastic inputs associated with various sources of uncertainty in the simulation of fluid flows leads to high dimensional representations that are computationally prohibitive. We investigate the use of adaptive ANOVA decomposition as an effective dimension-reduction technique in modeling steady incompressible and compressible flows with nominal dimension of random space up to 100. We present three different adaptivity criteria and compare the adaptive ANOVA method against sparse grid, Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods to evaluate its relative efficiency and accuracy. For the incompressible flow problem, the effect of random temperature boundary conditions (modeled as high-dimensional stochastic processes) on the Nusselt number is investigated for different values of correlation length. For the compressible flow, the effects of random geometric perturbations (simulating random roughness) on the scattering of a strong shock wave is investigated both analytically and numerically. A probabilistic collocation method is combined with adaptive ANOVA to obtain both incompressible and compressible flow solutions. We demonstrate that for both cases even draconian truncations of the ANOVA expansion lead to accurate solutions with a speed-up factor of three orders of magnitude compared to Monte Carlo and at least one order of magnitude compared to sparse grids for comparable accuracy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Rojas2010,
abstract = {Groundwater models are often used to predict the future behaviour of groundwater systems. These models may vary in complexity from simplified system conceptualizations to more intricate versions. It has been recently suggested that uncertainties in model predictions are largely dominated by uncertainties arising from the definition of alternative conceptual models. Different external factors such as climatic conditions or groundwater abstraction policies, on the other hand, may also play an important role. Rojas et al. (2008) proposed a multimodel approach to account for predictive uncertainty arising from forcing data (inputs), parameters and alternative conceptualizations. In this work we extend upon this approach to include uncertainties arising from the definition of alternative future scenarios and we apply the extended methodology to a real aquifer system underlying the Walenbos Nature Reserve area in Belgium. Three alternative conceptual models comprising different levels of geological knowledge are considered. Additionally, three recharge settings (scenarios) are proposed to evaluate recharge uncertainties. A joint estimation of the predictive uncertainty including parameter, conceptual model and scenario uncertainties is estimated for groundwater budget terms. Finally, results obtained using the improved approach are compared with the results obtained from methodologies that include a calibration step and which use a model selection criterion to discriminate between alternative conceptualizations. Results showed that conceptual model and scenario uncertainties significantly contribute to the predictive variance for some budget terms. Besides, conceptual model uncertainties played an important role even for the case when a model was preferred over the others. Predictive distributions showed to be considerably different in shape, central moment and spread among alternative conceptualizations and scenarios analysed. This reaffirms the idea that relying on a single conceptual model driven by a particular scenario, will likely produce bias and under-dispersive estimations of the predictive uncertainty. Multimodel methodologies based on the use of model selection criteria produced ambiguous results. In the frame of a multimodel approach, these inconsistencies are critical and can not be neglected. These results strongly advocate the idea of addressing conceptual model uncertainty in groundwater modelling practice. Additionally, considering alternative future recharge uncertainties will permit to obtain more realistic and, possibly, more reliable estimations of the predictive uncertainty. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Moreover, the accuracy of the representation improves no matter the regularity of the random quantity of interest. Therefore, the method is particularly well suited when nonlinear transformations of random variables are in play and can be viewed as a new way of tackling the Gibbs phenomenon. We apply the method to several test cases with different levels of regularity, dimensionality and complexity, including the case of compressible gas dynamics and long time-integration problems.

@article{Porte-Agel2013,
abstract = {In this study, large-eddy simulations (LESs) were performed to investigate the effects of changing wind direction on the turbine wakes and associated power losses in the Horns Rev offshore wind farm. In the LES framework, the turbulent subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized using a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic model, and the turbine-induced forces are computed using a dynamic actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R). This dynamic ADM-R couples blade-element theory with a turbine-specific relation between the blade angular velocity and the shaft torque to compute simultaneously turbine angular velocity and power output. A total of 67 simulations were performed for a wide range of wind direction angles. Results from the simulations show a strong impact of wind direction on the spatial distribution of turbine-wake characteristics, such as velocity deficit and turbulence intensity. This can be explained by the fact that changing the wind angle can be viewed as changing the wind farm layout relative to the incoming wind, while keeping the same wind turbine density. Of particular importance is the effect of wind direction on the distance available for the wakes to recover and expand before encountering other downwind turbines (in full-wake or partial-wake interactions), which affects the power losses from those turbines. As a result, even small changes in wind direction angle can have strong impacts on the total wind farm power output. For example, a change in wind direction of just 10° from the worst-case full-wake condition is found to increase the total power output by as much as 43{\%}. This has important implications for the design of wind farms and the management of the temporal variability of their power output.},

abstract = {In planning offshore wind farms, short-term wind speeds play a central role in estimating various engineering parameters, such as power output, extreme wind load, and fatigue load. Lacking wind speed time series of sufficient length, the probability distribution of wind speed serves as the primary substitute for data when estimating design parameters. It is common practice to model short-term wind speeds with the Weibull distribution. Using 10-min wind speed time series at 178 ocean buoy stations ranging from 1 month to 20 years in duration, we show that the widely-accepted Weibull distribution provides a poor fit to the distribution of wind speeds when compared with more complicated models. We compare distributions in terms of three different metrics: probability plot R2, estimates of average turbine power output, and estimates of extreme wind speed. While the Weibull model generally gives larger R2 than any other 2-parameter distribution, the bimodal Weibull, Kappa, and Wakeby models all show R2 values significantly closer to 1 than the other distributions considered (including the Weibull), with the bimodal Weibull giving the best fits. The Kappa and Wakeby distributions fit the upper tail (higher wind speeds) of a sample better than the bimodal Weibull, but may drastically over-estimate the frequency of lower wind speeds. Because the average turbine power is controlled by high wind speeds, the Kappa and Wakeby estimate average turbine power output very well, with the Kappa giving the least bias and mean square error out of all the distributions. The 2-parameter Lognormal distribution performs best for estimating extreme wind speeds, but still gives estimates with significant error. The fact that different distributions excel under different applications motivates further research on model selection based upon the engineering parameter of interest. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present results from the Bayesian calibration of hydrological parameters of the Community Land Model (CLM), which is often used in climate simulations and Earth system models. A statistical inverse problem is formulated for three hydrological parameters, conditioned on observations of latent heat surface fluxes over 48 months. Our calibration method uses polynomial and Gaussian process surrogates of the CLM and solves the parameter estimation problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Posterior probability densities for the parameters are developed for two sites with different soil and vegetation covers. Our method also allows us to examine the structural error in the CLM under two error models. We find that accurate surrogate models could be created for the CLM in three out of the four cases we investigated. The posterior distributions lead to better prediction than the default parameter values in CLM. Climatologically averaging the observations does not modify the parameters' distributions sig...},

abstract = {Linear estimation has found many applications in the inference of spatial functions in surface and subsurface hydrology. The effect of parameter uncertainty is examined in a Bayesian framework with emphasis on the derivation of the Bayesian distribution (and its first two moments) of unknown quantities given some measurements. This distribution accounts not only for natural variability but also for parameter uncertainty. For known covariance parameters the Bayesian distribution is Gaussian (for Gaussian processes) with the mean being a given linear function of the data. This linear estimator is equivalent to the conventional Gaussian conditional mean estimator for a priori known drift coefficients and is the same with kriging for diffuse prior distribution of the drift coefficients; however, the developed procedure is more general. When both drift and covariance function parameters are uncertain, the Bayesian distribution is generally not Gaussian, and the Bayesian conditional mean is a nonlinear estimator. The case of diffuse priors is examined in some detail; it is shown that the posterior distribution of the covariance function parameters is given by the restricted likelihood function, i.e., the likelihood function of generalized increments. The results provide insight into the applicability of maximum likelihood versus restricted maximum likelihood parameter estimation, and conventional linear versus kriging estimation. A more general procedure which includes these methods as special cases is presented.},

abstract = {A new approach to modeling inverse problems using a Bayesian inference method is introduced. The Bayesian approach considers the unknown parameters as random variables and seeks the probabilistic distribution of the unknowns. By introducing the concept of the stochastic prior state space to the Bayesian formulation, we reformulate the deterministic forward problem as a stochastic one. The adaptive hierarchical sparse grid collocation (ASGC) method is used for constructing an interpolant to the solution of the forward model in this prior space which is large enough to capture all the variability/uncertainty in the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters. This solution can be considered as a function of the random unknowns and serves as a stochastic surrogate model for the likelihood calculation. Hierarchical Bayesian formulation is used to derive the posterior probability density function (PPDF). The spatial model is represented as a convolution of a smooth kernel and a Markov random field. The state space of the PPDF is explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to obtain statistics of the unknowns. The likelihood calculation is performed by directly sampling the approximate stochastic solution obtained through the ASGC method. The technique is assessed on two nonlinear inverse problems: source inversion and permeability estimation in flow through porous media.},

@article{Lackner2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical approach to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and wind energy production estimation. The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a power curve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development. Many current methods for assessing uncertainty either oversimplify the process or make faulty assumptions, leading to erroneous estimates of uncertainty. The approach in this paper yields a more accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty, and therefore better decision making when assessing a potential wind energy site. Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, uncertainty in wind turbine power output and energy production is characterized. Third, a method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty when using a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonly assumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should be scaled by a factor between two and three to yield the uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that this assumption is an oversimplification, and also presents a closed form solution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters.},

The model developed here can be applied for similar regions where the wind speed distribution presents a bimodal PDF. The two-parameter Weibull wind speed distribution must not be generalised, since it is not accurate to represent some wind regimes as the case of La Ventosa, Mexico. The analysis of wind data shows that computing the capacity factor for wind power plants to be installed in La Ventosa must be carried out by means of a bimodal PDF instead of the typical Weibull PDF. Otherwise, the capacity factor will be underestimated. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian inference. Although typically less accurate than, for example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because they do not require the specification of a likelihood function. For this reason considerable amounts of data can be analysed and more complex models can be used providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model to the data. Since its first applications in the late 1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The framework was originally developed to solve problems in population genetics. However, as its efficiency was recognized its popularity increased and, consequently, it started to be used in fields as diverse as phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is still being greatly studied and alterations to it are being proposed, the statistical approach has already reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the number of related computer packages that are being developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the expansion of the use of this method can only increase. In this paper we are going to depict the context that led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to describe its current usage in such field and present its most recent developments. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Lu2012,
abstract = {Confidence intervals based on classical regression theories augmented to include prior information and credible intervals based on Bayesian theories are conceptually different ways to quantify parametric and predictive uncertainties. Because both confidence and credible intervals are used in environmental modeling, we seek to understand their differences and similarities. This is of interest in part because calculating confidence intervals typically requires tens to thousands of model runs, while Bayesian credible intervals typically require tens of thousands to millions of model runs. Given multi-Gaussian distributed observation errors, our theoretical analysis shows that, for linear or linearized-nonlinear models, confidence and credible intervals are always numerically identical when consistent prior information is used. For nonlinear models, nonlinear confidence and credible intervals can be numerically identical if parameter confidence regions defined using the approximate likelihood method and parameter credible regions estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo realizations are numerically identical and predictions are a smooth, monotonic function of the parameters. Both occur if intrinsic model nonlinearity is small. While the conditions of Gaussian errors and small intrinsic model nonlinearity are violated by many environmental models, heuristic tests using analytical and numerical models suggest that linear and nonlinear confidence intervals can be useful approximations of uncertainty even under significantly nonideal conditions. In the context of epistemic model error for a complex synthetic nonlinear groundwater problem, the linear and nonlinear confidence and credible intervals for individual models performed similarly enough to indicate that the computationally frugal confidence intervals can be useful in many circumstances. Experiences with these groundwater models are expected to be broadly applicable to many environmental models. We suggest that for environmental problems with lengthy execution times thatmake credible intervals inconvenient or prohibitive, confidence intervals can provide important insight. Duringmodel development when frequent calculation of uncertainty intervals is important to understanding the consequences of various model construction alternatives and data collection strategies, strategic use of both confidence and credible intervals can be critical.},

abstract = {We present an efficient numerical strategy for the Bayesian solution of inverse problems. Stochastic collocation methods, based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solution over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a surrogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal computational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior. The numerical strategy and the predicted convergence rates are then demonstrated on nonlinear inverse problems of varying smoothness and dimension. {\textcopyright} 2009 Global-Science Press.},

Changes in the new edition include: Stronger focus on MCMCRevision of the computational advice in Part IIINew chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysisSeveral additional applied examples from the authors' recent researchAdditional chapters on current models for Bayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and moreReorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collectionBayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation. The new approach, additional examples, and updated information make Bayesian Data Analysis an excellent introductory text and a reference that working scientists will use throughout their professional life.},

abstract = {In this paper has been investigated an analysis of wind characteristics of four stations (Elazig, Elazig-Maden, Elazig-Keban, and Elazig-Agin) over a period of 8 years (1998-2005). The probabilistic distributions of wind speed are a critical piece of information needed in the assessment of wind energy potential, and have been conventionally described by various empirical correlations. Among the empirical correlations, there are the Weibull distribution and the Maximum Entropy Principle. These wind speed distributions can not accurately represent all wind regimes observed in that region. However, this study represents a theoretical approach of wind speed frequency distributions observed in that region through applications of a Singly Truncated from below Normal Weibull mixture distribution and a two component mixture Weibull distribution and offer less relative errors in determining the annual mean wind power density. The parameters of the distributions are estimated using the least squares method and Statistica software. The suitability of the distributions is judged from the probability plot correlation coefficient plot R2, RMSE and ??2. Based on the results obtained, we conclude that the two mixture distributions proposed here provide very flexible models for wind speed studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

abstract = {In the design of wind turbines—onshore or offshore—the prediction of extreme loads as- sociated with a target (long) return period requires statistical extrapolation from available loads data. The data required for such extrapolation are obtained by stochastic time- domain simulation of the inflow turbulence and of the turbine response. Prediction of accurate loads depends on assumptions made in the simulation models employed, both for the turbine and for the input wind/wave conditions. While for the wind, inflow turbu- lence models are fairly well established due to the relative maturity of the industry for onshore wind energy development, for wave input, the current practice is to model irreg- ular (random) waves using a linear wave theory. These wave modeling assumptions do not adequately represent waves in shallow waters where most offshore wind turbines are being sited. As an alternative to these less realistic (albeit simple) representations of ocean waves, the present study investigates the use of irregular nonlinear (second-order) waves for estimating loads on the support structure (monopile) of an offshore wind turbine. We use a 5MW utility-scale wind turbine model for the simulations. Using, first, the sim- pler linear irregular wave modeling assumptions, we establish long-term loads and identify controlling environmental conditions (i.e., the wind speed and wave height) that are asso- ciated with the 20-year return period load derived using the inverse first-order reliability method. We then present the theory for an improved nonlinear second-order irregular wave modeling approach which we use to compute hydrodynamic loads on a stand-alone monopile analyzed quasi-statically for the controlling long-term design environmental con- ditions identified from the linear model. We demonstrate that computed hydrodynamic loads are generally larger with the nonlinear wave modeling assumptions; this establishes the importance of using such refined nonlinear wave models in stochastic simulation of the response of offshore wind turbines. This motivates the need for continuing work directed towards incorporation of nonlinear irregular wave models in turbine response simulation studies and loads extrapolation for design.},

In this study, we propose a simple and easily implementable method to construct joint distributions of wind speed and wind direction, which is based on the parameters of sector-wise Weibull distributions and interpolations between direction sectors. It is applied to the wind measurement data at Horns Rev and three different joint distributions are obtained, which all fit the measurement data quite well in terms of the coefficient of determination . Then, the best of these joint distributions is used in the layout optimization of the Horns Rev 1 wind farm and the choice of bin sizes for wind speed and wind direction is also investigated. It is found that the choice of bin size for wind direction is especially critical for layout optimization and the recommended choice of bin sizes for wind speed and wind direction is finally presented.},

abstract = {The planning of a wind farm, which minimizes the lifecycle project costs and maximizes the reliability of the expected power generation, presents significant challenges to today's wind energy industry. An optimal wind farm planning strategy that simultaneously (i) accounts for the key engineering design factors, and (ii) addresses the major sources of uncertainty in a wind farm, can offer a powerful solution to these daunting challenges. In this paper, we develop a new methodology to characterize the long term uncertainties, particularly those introduced by the ill-predictability of the annual variation in wind conditions (wind speed and direction, and air density). The annual variation in wind conditions is represented using a non-parametric wind distribution model. The uncertainty in the predicted annual wind distribution is then characterized using a set of lognormal distributions. The uncertainties in the estimated (i) farm power generation and (ii) Cost of energy (COE) are represented as functions of the variances of these lognormal distributions. Subsequently, we minimize the uncertainty in the COE through wind farm optimization. To this end, we apply the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) framework, which provides a comprehensive platform for wind farm design. This methodology for robust wind farm optimization is applied to design a 25MW wind farm in N. Dakota. We found that layout optimization is appreciably sensitive to the uncertainties in wind conditions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 by Achille Messac.},

abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of determining the effect of input uncertainties on response metrics of interest. These input uncertainties may be characterized as either aleatory uncertainties, which are irreducible variabilities inherent in nature, or epistemic uncertainties, which are reducible uncertainties resulting from a lack of knowledge. When both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are mixed, it is desirable to maintain a segregation between aleatory and epistemic sources such that it is easy to separate and identify their contributions to the total uncertainty. Current production analyses for mixed UQ employ the use of nested sampling, where each sample taken from epistemic distributions at the outer loop results in an inner loop sampling over the aleatory probability distributions. This paper demonstrates new algorithmic capabilities for mixed UQ in which the analysis procedures are more closely tailored to the requirements of aleatory and epistemic propagation. Through the combination of stochastic expansions for computing statistics and interval optimization for computing bounds, interval-valued probability, second-order probability, and DempsterShafer evidence theory approaches to mixed UQ are shown to be more accurate and efficient than previously achievable. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wind tunnel test measurements to characterize the static lift and drag coefficients of airfoils used in wind turbine blades are shown to possess large uncertainties, which leads to uncertainties in the aerodynamic loads on the rotor. In this paper a rational stochastic model is proposed to quantify the uncertainty in airfoil static lift and drag coefficients based on field and wind tunnel data, aero-servo-elastic calculations and engineering judgment. The stochastic model is subsequently used to assess the effect of the uncertainty in airfoil static lift and drag coefficients on the prediction of extreme loads and structural reliability of large wind turbines. It is shown that the uncertainty in the static airfoil data has a significant impact on the prediction of extreme loads effects and structural reliability depending on the component, operating conditions (stand-still versus power production) and the correlations of aerodynamic variables along the span of the blades.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

abstract = {The theory of port-Hamiltonian systems provides a framework for the geometric description of network models of physical systems. It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system. The port-Hamiltonian description offers a systematic framework for analysis, control and simulation of complex physical systems, for lumped-parameter as well as for distributed-parameter models.},

abstract = {Bayesian analysis has become vital to uncertainty quantification in groundwater modeling, but its application has been hindered by the computational cost associated with numerous model executions required by exploring the posterior probability density function (PPDF) of model parameters. This is particularly the case when the PPDF is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In this study, a new approach is developed to improve the computational efficiency of Bayesian inference by constructing a surrogate of the PPDF, using an adaptive sparse-grid high-order stochastic collocation (aSG-hSC) method. Unlike previous works using first-order hierarchical basis, this paper utilizes a compactly supported higher-order hierarchical basis to construct the surrogate system, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of required model executions. In addition, using the hierarchical surplus as an error indicator allows locally adaptive refinement of sparse grids in the parameter space, which further improves computational efficiency. To efficiently build the surrogate system for the PPDF with multiple significant modes, optimization techniques are used to identify the modes, for which high-probability regions are defined and components of the aSG-hSC approximation are constructed. After the surrogate is determined, the PPDF can be evaluated by sampling the surrogate system directly without model execution, resulting in improved efficiency of the surrogate-based MCMC compared with conventional MCMC. The developed method is evaluated using two synthetic groundwater reactive transport models. The first example involves coupled linear reactions and demonstrates the accuracy of our high-order hierarchical basis approach in approximating high-dimensional posteriori distribution. The second example is highly nonlinear because of the reactions of uranium surface complexation, and demonstrates how the iterative aSG-hSC method is able to capture multimodal and non-Gaussian features of PPDF caused by model nonlinearity. Both experiments show that aSG-hSC is an effective and efficient tool for Bayesian inference.},

abstract = {We revisit the stability of a deformable interface that separates a fully-developed turbulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid. Although this problem has received considerable attention previously, a model that requires no fitting parameters and that uses a base-state profile that has been validated against experiments is, as yet, unavailable. Furthermore, the significance of wave-induced perturbations in turbulent stresses remains unclear. To address these outstanding issues, we investigate this problem and introduce a turbulent base-state velocity that requires specification of a flow rate or a pressure drop only; no adjustable parameters are necessary. This base state is validated extensively against available experimental data as well as the results of direct numerical simulations. In addition, the effect of perturbations in the turbulent stress distributions is investigated, and demonstrated to be small for cases wherein the liquid layer is thin. The detailed modelling of the liquid layer also elicits two unstable modes, 'interfacial' and 'internal', with the former being the more dominant of the two. We show that it is possible for interfacial roughness to reduce the growth rate of the interfacial mode in relation to that of the internal one, promoting the latter, to the status of most dangerous mode. Additionally, we introduce an approximate measure to distinguish between 'slow' and 'fast' waves, the latter being the case for 'critical-layer'-induced instabilities; we demonstrate that for the parameter ranges studied, the large majority of the waves are 'slow'. Finally, comparisons of our linear stability predictions are made with experimental data in terms of critical parameters for onset of wave-formation, wave speeds and wavelengths; these yield agreement within the bounds of experimental error. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Five parameters are inverted: the porosity, tortuosity, viscous characteristic length, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio of the skeletal frame.

abstract = {In this study, an efficient Bayesian method based on the adaptive sparse grid interpolation is used to solve the contaminant source identification problem. The unknown parameters that characterize the contaminant source are treated as random variables and identified by the Bayesian approach. To alleviate the computational burden in the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, a surrogate system with the polynomial form is constructed by the stochastic collocation method (SCM), which employs the interpolation based on the sparse grids rather than those based on the full tensor product. Furthermore, an adaptive scheme is used to take the different importance of the parameters into account. Therefore, the computational burden is significantly reduced. Once the surrogate system is determined, the likelihood can be evaluated by sampling the surrogate system directly, with very little computational cost. To improve the accuracy, we propose an auxiliary SCM based approach, where the surrogate system serves as a guidance for the fast adaption of the proposal distribution in the MCMC method. Numerical cases show that, under certain conditions, this method can greatly reduce the computational burden in the MCMC sampling and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant source. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We derive a flat-interface model to describe the flow of two horizontal, stably stratified fluids, where the bottom layer exhibits non-Newtonian rheology. The model takes into account the yield stress and power-law nature of the bottom fluid. In the light of the large viscosity contrast assumed to exist across the fluid interface, and for large pressure drops in the streamwise direction, the possibility for the upper Newtonian layer to display fully developed turbulence must be considered, and is described in our model. We develop a linear-stability analysis to predict the conditions under which the flat-interface state becomes unstable, and pay particular attention to characterizing the influence of the non-Newtonian rheology on the instability. Increasing the yield stress (up to the point where unyielded regions form in the bottom layer) is destabilizing; increasing the flow index, while bringing a broader spectrum of modes into play, is stabilizing. In addition, a second mode of instability is found, which depends on conditions in the bottom layer. For shear-thinning fluids, this second mode becomes more unstable, and yet more bottom-layer modes can become unstable for a suitable reduction in the flow index. One further difference between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases is the development of unyielded regions in the bottom layer, as the linear wave on the interface grows in time. These unyielded regions form in the trough of the wave, and can be observed in the linear analysis for a suitable parameter choice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A farm planning strategy that simultaneously accounts for the key engineering design factors and addresses the uncertainties in a wind project can offer a powerful impetus to the development of wind energy. In this context, the resource itself is highly uncertain ? wind conditions, including wind speed, wind direction, and air density, show strong temporal variations; in addition, the distribution of wind conditions varies significantly from year to year. The resulting ill-predictability of the annual distribution of wind conditions introduces significant uncertainties in the estimated resource potential or the predicted performance of the wind farm. In this paper, a new methodology is developed (i) to characterize the uncertainties in the annual distribution of wind conditions, and (ii) to model the propagation of uncertainties into the local wind power density (WPD) and into farm performance evaluation. Key measures of farm performance include annual energy production (AEP), cost of energy (COE), and payback period. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainty models are formulated, which can be leveraged in conjunction with a wide variety of stochastic wind distribution models. The AEP and the COE are evaluated using advanced analytical models, adopted from the recently developed Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO) framework. The year-to-year variations in the wind distribution and the quantified uncertainties are illustrated using two case studies: an onshore and an offshore wind site. Appreciable uncertainties are observed in the estimated yearly WPDs over the 10-year period ? approximately 11{\%} for the onshore site and 30{\%} for the offshore site. The uncertainty in COE is mitigated for the onshore site using the nonparametric uncertainty model within the UWFLO framework. The ensuing robust optimization process illustrated how important it is to reduce the sensitivity of the farm performance to unreliable wind conditions, even though they may be frequent in certain years and/or contain higher energy density.},

abstract = {A new methodology, the Unrestricted Wind Farm Layout Optimization (UWFLO), that addresses critical aspects of optimal wind farm planning is presented in this paper. This methodology simultaneously determines the optimum farm layout and the appropriate selection of turbines (in terms of their rotor diameters) that maximizes the net power generation. The farm layout model obviates traditional restrictions imposed on the location of turbines. A standard analytical wake model has been used to account for the velocity deficits in the wakes created by individual turbines. The wind farm power generation model is validated against data from a wind tunnel experiment on a scaled down wind farm. Reasonable agreement between the model and experimental results is obtained. The complex nonlinear optimization problem presented by the wind farm model is effectively solved using constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It is found that an optimal combination of wind turbines with differing rotor diameters can appreciably improve the farm efficiency. A preliminary wind farm cost analysis is performed to express the cost in terms of the turbine rotor diameters and the number of turbines in the farm. Subsequent exploration of the influences of (i) the number of turbines, and (ii) the farm land size, on the cost per Kilowatt of power produced, yields important observations. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is often the case that the numerical simulation of two phase flows leads to a number of difficulties associated with the solution algorithms utilized. Those difficulties manifest themselves as an impossibility to converge the iterative solution process, typical of the finite-volume pressure-correction methods, and are particularly persistent in cases with phase segregation (complete, or almost complete, separation of one phase from the other) and with fine meshes. A number of effective measures to overcome such problems are here proposed and tested, encompassing: (1) modification of the momentum equations formulation in a way that avoids singularity as volume fractions ($\alpha$) tend to zero; (2) bounding of the volume fractions during the iterative algorithm in a way that enforces the physical limits, $\alpha$0 and 1; (3) symmetric treatment of some terms in the equations, and consistent formulation of cell-face fluxes in order to prevent numerical-induced oscillations.

abstract = {Multi-element uncertainty quantification approaches can robustly resolve the high sensitivities caused by discontinuities in parametric space by reducing the polynomial degree locally to a piecewise linear approximation. It is important to extend the higher degree interpolation in the smooth regions up to a thin layer of linear elements that contain the discontinuity to maintain a highly accurate solution. This is achieved here by introducing Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) type stencil selection into the Simplex Stochastic Collocation (SSC) method. For each simplex in the discretization of the parametric space, the stencil with the highest polynomial degree is selected from the set of candidate stencils to construct the local response surface approximation. The application of the resulting SSC-ENO method to a discontinuous test function shows a sharper resolution of the jumps and a higher order approximation of the percentiles near the singularity. SSC-ENO is also applied to a chemical model problem and a shock tube problem to study the impact of uncertainty both on the formation of discontinuities in time and on the location of discontinuities in space. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In spite of this success, wind energy has still not made a definitive breakthrough. The main reason for this is that it has to compete with conventionally generated electricity, which often is cheaper, or at least appears to be if environmental costs are not taken into account. For wind to make a really substantial contribution to world energy supply, it is therefore imperative that the cost ofwind energy is brought down even further,which means thatwind turbines must be designed to be exactly as strong as necessary, but no stronger.

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have found widespread use in many fields of study to estimate the average properties of complex systems, and for posterior inference in a Bayesian framework. Existing theory and experiments prove convergence of well-constructed MCMC schemes to the appropriate limiting distribution under a variety of different conditions. In practice, however this convergence is often observed to be disturbingly slow. This is frequently caused by an inappropriate selection of the proposal distribution used to generate trial moves in the Markov Chain. Here we show that significant improvements to the efficiency of MCMC simulation can be made by using a self-adaptive Differential Evolution learning strategy within a population-based evolutionary framework. This scheme, entitled Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis or DREAM, runs multiple different chains simultaneously for global exploration, and automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution in randomized subspaces during the search. Ergodicity of the algorithm is proved, and various examples involving nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and multimodality show that DREAM is generally Superior to other adaptive MCMC sampling approaches. The DREAM scheme significantly enhances the applicability of MCMC simulation to Complex, multi-modal search problems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we apply Bayesian uncertainty quantification techniques to the processes of calibrating complex mathematical models and predicting quantities of interest (QoI's) with such models. These techniques also enable the systematic comparison of competing model classes. The processes of calibration and comparison constitute the building blocks of a larger validation process, the goal of which is to accept or reject a given mathematical model for the prediction of a particular QoI for a particular scenario. In this work, we take the first step in this process by applying the methodology to the analysis of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model in the context of incompressible, boundary layer flows. Three competing model classes based on the Spalart–Allmaras model are formulated, calibrated against experimental data, and used to issue a prediction with quantified uncertainty. The model classes are compared in terms of their posterior probabilities and their prediction of QoI's. The model posterior probability represents the relative plausibility of a model class given the data. Thus, it incorporates the model's ability to fit experimental observations. Alternatively, comparing models using the predicted QoI connects the process to the needs of decision makers that use the results of the model. We show that by using both the model plausibility and predicted QoI, one has the opportunity to reject some model classes after calibration, before subjecting the remaining classes to additional validation challenges.},

abstract = {When modeling physical systems, several sources of uncertainty are present. For example, variability in boundary conditions like free stream velocity or ambient pressure are always present. Furthermore, uncertainties in geometry arise from production tolerances, wear or unknown deformations under loading. Uncertainties in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can have a significant impact on the computed aerodynamic performance. Since CFD simulations are computationally intensive, an efficient uncertainty quantification approach is  required.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe main objective of this research is to obtain an efficient approach for uncertainty quantification in CFD simulations. This was achieved by focusing on efficient uncertainty propagation and the practical applicability to a wide range of test cases. The Probabilistic Collocation method was developed as an efficient non-intrusive uncertainty propagation method. It is based on the polynomial chaos framework and shows spectral convergence with respect to the polynomial chaos order. Its effectiveness was demonstrated on several flow cases using a commercial CFD solver.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFor cases with a discontinuous response or involving long time integration, modifications of the Probabilistic Collocation method were used to efficiently propagate the uncertainties. A Multi-element formulation was successfully applied to capture the discontinuous response of a stall flutter problem. Furthermore, a time-independent parameterization was used to efficiently propagate uncertainties in case of vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder, which required long time integration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGeometric uncertainties were shown to have a significant influence on the aerodynamic performance. Since geometric uncertainties affect the shape, a new computational grid should be computed for every collocation point in the Probabilistic Collocation method. To efficiently treat geometric uncertainties in CFD, a grid deformation technique was used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMost CFD simulations in this thesis involved solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This required a turbulence model to close the system of equations. Turbulence models often contain several parameters that are tuned to computed or measured simplified flow problems, which introduces uncertainty in the model. Uncertainty quantification was applied to the parameters of the k-ǫ turbulence model in combination with wall functions in the cases of flow over a flat plate and flow around a NACA0012 airfoil. The drag coefficient showed a coefficient of variation of 3-4{\%} for both cases. The wall function parameters $\kappa$ and C and the model parameter C$\mu$ proved to affect the solution most. General conclusions require more test cases, like a shear layer and an expanding jet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCompressor rotors are components of a gasturbine that are highly sensitive to operational and geometrical uncertainties. Operational uncertainties like static outlet pressure and the total pressure profile at the inlet of the rotor were considered. The Probabilistic Collocation method was validated using a Monte Carlo simulation using 10,000 Latin Hypercube samples. It was shown that the mass flow was most sensitive to the uncertainty in the total pressure profile at the inlet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMultiple uncertainties were shown to be effectively handled using a two-step approach. The first step was a screening of the parameters. A sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most important parameters of the problem. Here it was assumed that all parameters are independent and have no combined effects. Secondly, the probability density functions of the most important parameters are propagated using the Probabilistic Collocation method. The Probabilistic Radial Basis Function approach was developed as an alternative efficient approach for multiple uncertain parameters. To obtain an accuracy of 0.01-0.001 for the mean and variance, the CFD test cases required 10-35 support points for 3 uncertain parameters. Close agreement between the Probabilistic Radial Basis Function approach and a Monte Carlo simulation using 10,000 Latin Hypercube samples was shown for flow around a RAE2822 airfoil with three uncertain parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt can be concluded that the Probabilistic Collocation method and adapted versions are capable of efficiently propagating uncertainties in CFD simulations. The development of the Probabilistic Radial Basis Function approach provided an efficient alternative for cases with multiple uncertain parameters. From the test cases it became clear that there is not a single method that is most efficient for all possible cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nUncertainty quantification increases the reliability of CFD computations, since the effect of uncertain parameters on the output of interest is quantified. It was shown that small coefficients of variation of uncertain parameters can lead to a significant variability of the aerodynamic performance. Taking uncertainties into account in CFD simulation is therefore of great importance and with the current state of technology feasible for many real world applications.},

These fast, efficient, and accurate methods are an extension of the classical spectral methods of high-dimensional random spaces. Designed to simulate complex systems subject to random inputs, these methods are widely used in many areas of computer science and engineering. The book introduces polynomial approximation theory and probability theory, describes the basic theory of gPC methods through numerical examples and rigorous development, details the procedure for converting stochastic equations into deterministic ones, using both the Galerkin and collocation approaches, and discusses the distinct differences and challenges arising from high-dimensional problems. The last section is devoted to the application of gPC methods to critical areas such as inverse problems and data assimilation. Ideal for use by graduate students and researchers both in the classroom and for self-study, Numerical Methods for Stochastic Computations provides the required tools for in-depth research related to stochastic computations.The first graduate-level textbook to focus on the fundamentals of numerical methods for stochastic computations Ideal introduction for graduate courses or self-study Fast, efficient, and accurate numerical methods Polynomial approximation theory and probability theory included Basic gPC methods illustrated through examples},

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

abstract = {We explore the use of probability models for uncertainty arising from discretiza-tion of system states defined implicitly by ordinary or partial differential equa-tions. Accounting for this uncertainty is vital in avoiding posterior under-coverage when likelihoods are constructed based on a coarse numerical approximation over a finite discretization grid. A formalism for inferring fixed but a priori unknown model trajectories is proposed within the forward problem through Bayesian up-dating of sequentially refined prior models conditional on model information. A one-step-ahead sampling scheme for interrogating the model is studied in detail, its consistency and first order convergence properties are proved. The proposed approach is demonstrated to capture the functional structure and magnitude of the discretization error, while attaining computational scaling of the same or-der as traditional first order numerical methods, and defining a trade-off between accuracy and discretization grid size. Examples illustrate the flexibility of this framework to deal with a wide variety of models that include initial value, delay, and boundary value ordinary differential equations, as well as partial differential equations. Scalability is illustrated for a model of fluid dynamics consisting of over 16,000 coupled, stiff ordinary differential equations. Within the inverse prob-lem, discretization uncertainty is defined as an additional layer in the Bayesian hierarchy, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that targets the result-ing posterior distribution is presented. This formalism is used to infer states and parameters for the JAK-STAT delay differential equation network of protein dy-namics from indirectly observed measurements. Finally, the discussion outlines a wide range of emerging research themes in the new field of probabilistic numerics that follow from the work presented.},

abstract = {An overview of a comprehensive framework is given for estimating the predictive uncertainty of scientific computing applications. The framework is comprehensive in the sense that it treats both types of uncertainty (aleatory and epistemic), incorporates uncertainty due to the mathematical form of the model, and it provides a procedure for including estimates of numerical error in the predictive uncertainty. Aleatory (random) uncertainties in model inputs are treated as random variables, while epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainties are treated as intervals with no assumed probability distributions. Approaches for propagating both types of uncertainties through the model to the system response quantities of interest are briefly discussed. Numerical approximation errors (due to discretization, iteration, and computer round off) are estimated using verification techniques, and the conversion of these errors into epistemic uncertainties is discussed. Model form uncertainty is quantified using (a) model validation procedures, i.e., statistical comparisons of model predictions to available experimental data, and (b) extrapolation of this uncertainty structure to points in the application domain where experimental data do not exist. Finally, methods for conveying the total predictive uncertainty to decision makers are presented. The different steps in the predictive uncertainty framework are illustrated using a simple example in computational fluid dynamics applied to a hypersonic wind tunnel.},

We focus our calibration on the model constants contained within the standard RANS k–$\epsilon$ turbulence model and the uncertainties relating to these values. Thus we are able to narrow down the space of k–$\epsilon$ model constants which provide the best match with experimental data and quantify the uncertainty relating to both the k–$\epsilon$ model constants in the case of street canyon flow and the TKE outputs of the CFD simulation. Furthermore, we are able to construct a statistical emulator of the CFD model.

@article{Mackay1998,
abstract = {Feedforward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons are popular tools for nonlinear regression and classification problems. From a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be viewed as defining a prior probability distribution over non-linear functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but otherwise standard networks, Neal (1996) has shown that the prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network model determine the characteristic length scales of the Gaussian process. Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. In this chapter I will review work on this idea by Williams and Rasmussen (1996), Neal (1997), Barber and Williams (1997) and Gibbs and MacKay (1997), and will assess whether, for supervised regression and classification tasks, the feedforward network has been superceded.},

abstract = {Simulations of blood flow in both healthy and diseased vascular models can be used to compute a range of hemodynamic parameters including velocities, time varying wall shear stress, pressure drops, and energy losses. The confidence in the data output from cardiovascular simulations depends directly on our level of certainty in simulation input parameters. In this work, we develop a general set of tools to evaluate the sensitivity of output parameters to input uncertainties in cardiovascular simulations. Uncertainties can arise from boundary conditions, geometrical parameters, or clinical data. These uncertainties result in a range of possible outputs which are quantified using probability density functions (PDFs). The objective is to systemically model the input uncertainties and quantify the confidence in the output of hemodynamic simulations. Input uncertainties are quantified and mapped to the stochastic space using the stochastic collocation technique. We develop an adaptive collocation algorithm for Gauss-Lobatto-Chebyshev grid points that significantly reduces computational cost. This analysis is performed on two idealized problems--an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a carotid artery bifurcation, and one patient specific problem--a Fontan procedure for congenital heart defects. In each case, relevant hemodynamic features are extracted and their uncertainty is quantified. Uncertainty quantification of the hemodynamic simulations is done using (a) stochastic space representations, (b) PDFs, and (c) the confidence intervals for a specified level of confidence in each problem.},

In this work, we investigate experimentally the flow characteristics of air/shear-thinning liquid systems in horizontal and slightly inclined smooth pipes. The experiments are performed in a 9-m-long glass pipe using air and three different carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solutions as test fluids. Flow pattern maps are built by visual observation using a high-speed camera. The observed flow patterns are stratified, plug, and slug flow. The effects of the pipe inclination and the rheology of the shear-thinning fluid in terms of flow pattern maps are presented. The predicted existence region of the stratified flow regime is compared with the experimental observation showing a good agreement. A mechanistic model valid for air/power-law slug flow is proposed and model predictions are compared to the experimental data showing a good agreement. Slug flow characteristics are investigated by the analysis of the signals of a capacitance probe: slug velocity, slug frequency, and slug lengths are measured. A new correlation for the slug frequency is proposed and the results are promising.},

To this end, the flow was examined experimentally and numerically. On the experimental side, three non-intrusive optical techniques were combined and employed to determine the velocity field and bubble shape: particle image velocimetry (PIV), Pulsed Shadow Technique (PST) and Laser- Induced Fluorescence technique (LIF). Statistical information was provided by photogate cells installed at two axial positions. The flow was numerically determined based on the one-dimensional Two-Fluid Model. The tests were conducted on a specially built transparent pipe test section, using air and water as the working fluids. The velocity fields were obtained for flow regimes where the slugs were slightly aerated to facilitate the utilization of the optical methods employed. The main parameters for characterizing the statistically steady flow regime such as slug length and velocity obtained numerically were compared with the experimental data and good agreement was obtained.},

abstract = {This thesis analyses models for twophase flows and methods for the numerical resolution of these models. It is therefore one contribution to the development of reliable design tools for multiphase applications. Such tools are needed and expected by engineers in a range of fields, including in the oil and gas industry. The approximate Riemann solver of Roe has been studied. Roe schemes for three different twophase flow models have been implemented in the framework of a standard numerical algorithm for the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. The schemes have been analysed by calculation of benchmark tests from the literature, and by comparison with each other. A Roe scheme for the has been implemented, and a secondorder extension based on wave decomposition and fluxdifference splitting was shown to work well and to give improved results compared to the firstorder scheme. The convergence properties of the scheme were tested on smooth and discontinuous solutions. A Roe scheme has been proposed for pressure relaxation. The use of analogous numerical methods for the fiveequation and fourequation models allowed for a direct comparison of a method with and without pressure relaxation. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the two approaches converged to the same results, but that the was significantly more dissipative, particularly for contact discontinuities. Furthermore, even though the fiveequation model with instantaneous pressure relaxation has real eigenvalues, the calculations showed that it produced oscillations for cases where the fourequation model had complex eigenvalues. A Roe scheme has been constructed for the driftflux model with general closure laws. For the case of the Zuber-Findlay slip law describing bubbly flows, the Roe matrix is completely analytical. Hence the present Roe scheme is more efficient than previous fully numerical Roe schemes for the driftflux model. An isentropic has been presented. The incorporation of different interfacialpressure models was discussed, and examples were given. With the adequate models for the interfacial pressure and velocity, the agreement was very good between the discreteequation model and the fiveequation Roe scheme. The fluxlimiter centred (flic) scheme was tested for the the firstorder version (force) of the scheme was found to work well, but it was rather diffusive. The purpose of the multistage (musta) method is to come close to the accuracy of upwind schemes while retaining the simplicity of centred schemes. Here it has been applied to the driftflux model. As the number of stages was increased, the results of the musta scheme approached those of the Roe method. The good results of the musta scheme were dependent on the use of a largeenough local grid. Hence, the main advantage of the musta scheme is its simplicity. A multiphase has been tested, and it was shown to be workable for transient problems.},

The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data available for horizontal and for slightly downward inclined air/shear thinning fluid stratified flow taken from literature. The predictions of the pre-integrated model are validated showing a good agreement when compared with experimental data. The criteria for the transition from the stratified flow pattern are applied to gas/non-Newtonian stratified flow. The neutral stability analysis (smooth/wavy stratified flow) and the well-posedness (existence region of stratified flow) of governing equations are carry out. The predicted transition boundaries are obtained using the steady fully developed two-fluid model and the pre-integrated model, where the shape factors and their derivatives are accounted for. A comparison between the predicted boundaries and experimental flow pattern maps is presented and shows a good agreement.

abstract = {Stochastic Collocation (SC) has been studied and used in different disciplines for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). The method consists of computing a set of appropriate points, called collocation points, and then using Lagrange interpolation to construct the probability density function (pdf) of the quantity of interest (QoI). The collocation points are usually chosen as Gauss quadrature points, i.e., the roots of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the pdf of the uncertain inputs. If the mathematical model has more than one stochastic parameter, the multidimensional set of points is usually build using the tensor product of the roots of the one-dimensional orthogonal polynomials. As a result of that, for multidimensional problems the same set of collocation points is used for both correlated and uncorrelated inputs. In this work, we propose to compute an alternative set of points for correlated inputs. The set will be derived using the orthogonal polynomials for correlated inputs that we developed in a previous work. As these polynomials are not unique, we will obtain multiple sets of collocations points for each input pdf. The aim of this paper is to study the differences between those sets of points and to find and optimal one.},

abstract = {The turbulence closure model is the dominant source of error in most Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, yet no reliable estimators for this error component currently exist. Here we develop a stochastic, a posteriori error estimate, calibrated to specific classes of flow. It is based on variability in model closure coefficients across multiple flow scenarios, for multiple closure models. The variability is estimated using Bayesian calibration against experimental data for each scenario, and Bayesian Model-Scenario Averaging (BMSA) is used to collate the resulting posteriors, to obtain a stochastic estimate of a Quantity of Interest (QoI) in an unmeasured (prediction) scenario. The scenario probabilities in BMSA are chosen using a sensor which automatically weights those scenarios in the calibration set which are similar to the prediction scenario. The methodology is applied to the class of turbulent boundary-layers subject to various pressure gradients. For all considered prediction scenarios the standard-deviation of the stochastic estimate is consistent with the measurement ground truth. Furthermore, the mean of the estimate is more consistently accurate than the individual model predictions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular we search for estimates grounded in uncertainties in the space of model closure coefficients, for wall-bounded flows at a variety of favorable and adverse pressure gradients. In order to estimate the spread of closure coefficients which reproduces these flows accurately, we perform 13 separate Bayesian calibrations - each at a different pressure gradient - using measured boundary-layer velocity profiles, and a statistical model containing a multiplicative model-inadequacy term in the solution space. The results are 13 joint posterior distributions over coefficients and hyper-parameters. To summarize this information we compute Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {The growing demand for hydrocarbon production has resulted into improved oilfield management with various control and optimization strategies. These strategies in turn strongly rely on the efficiency of downhole equipment which is used to obtain real-time oil and gas production rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, multiphase flowmeters installed downhole can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, existing multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i.e. to estimate flow rates from conventional meters, such as downhole pressure gauges, in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. The soft-sensors can also be used together with hardware sensors to improve their overall performance, e.g. by substituting missing data of the hardware sensor with output of the soft-senor. The research presented in this thesis discusses possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors. },

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Given a wind-farm with known dimensions and number of wind-turbines, we try to find the optimum positioning of wind-turbines that maximises wind-farm energy production. In practise, given that optimisation has to be performed for many wind directions and taking into account the yearly wind distribution, such an optimisation is computationally only feasible using fast engineering wake models such as, e.g., the Jensen model. These models are known to have accuracy issues, in particular since their representation of wake interaction is very simple. In the present work, we propose an optimisation approach that is based on a hybrid combination of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and the Jensen model, in which optimisation is mainly performed using the Jensen model, and LES is used at a few points only during optimisation for online tuning of the wake-expansion coefficient in the Jensen model, and for validation of the results. An optimisation case study is considered, in which the placement of 30 turbines in a 4 by 3 km rectangular domain is optimised in a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Both optimisation for single wind direction, and multiple wind directions are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {One very simple interpretation of calibration is to adjust a set of parameters associated with a computational science and engineering code so that the model agreement is maximized with respect to a set of experimental data. One very simple interpretation of validation is to quantify our belief in the predictive capability of a computational code through comparison with a set of experimental data. Uncertainty in both the data and the code are important and must be mathematically understood to correctly perform both calibration and validation. Sensitivity analysis, being an important methodology in uncertainty analysis, is thus important to both calibration and validation. In this paper, we intend to clarify the language just used and express some opinions on the associated issues. We will endeavor to identify some technical challenges that must be resolved for successful validation of a predictive modeling capability. One of these challenges is a formal description of a "model discrepancy" term. Another challenge revolves around the general adaptation of abstract learning theory as a formalism that potentially encompasses both calibration and validation in the face of model uncertainty. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper investigates the predictive accuracy of stochastic models. In particular, a formulation is presented for the impact of data limitations associated with the calibration of parameters for these models, on their overall predictive accuracy. In the course of this development, a new method for the characterization of stochastic processes from corresponding experimental observations is obtained. Specifically, polynomial chaos representations of these processes are estimated that are consistent, in some useful sense, with the data. The estimated polynomial chaos coefficients are themselves characterized as random variables with known probability density function, thus permitting the analysis of the dependence of their values on further experimental evidence. Moreover, the error in these coefficients, associated with limited data, is propagated through a physical system characterized by a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). This formalism permits the rational allocation of resources in view of studying the possibility of validating a particular predictive model. A Bayesian inference scheme is relied upon as the logic for parameter estimation, with its computational engine provided by a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure.},

abstract = {Consistent time integration on collocated grids for incompressible flow has been studied for static grids using the PISO method, in which the dependencies on time-step size and under-relaxation has been studied in detail. However, for moving grids a detailed description is still missing. Therefore, a step by step analysis of a time consistent fluid–structure interaction (FSI) method for incompressible flow on collocated grids is presented. The method consist of: face normal and area correction for moving grids, treatment of velocity boundary conditions for no-slip walls, time integration of structure equations and fluid force interpolation to structure. The basis of the method is the PISO method of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Time consistency on static grids is shown first, after which time consistency on moving grids is described and analyzed. For moving grids consistent time integration is described in two ways: (1) constructing the face velocities from a normal and tangential component, and (2) correcting the face flux with a face normal and face area correction. For both descriptions the general formulation for the backward differencing schemes (BDF) are given and the correct behavior of the first, second and third order schemes is demonstrated by means of an academic test case (circular cavity flow). Additionally, the (force) coupling from the fluid to the structure is discussed in detail for combining a fourth order explicit Runge Kutta scheme for the structure with a BDF scheme for the fluid. Three interpolations for the fluid forces are shown, which result in either a first order or second order FSI scheme. Third order FSI is demonstrated when the third order BDF scheme is applied on both the structure and fluid equations. Also, under-relaxation for the fluid equations is considered and it is demonstrated that the order of the three BDF schemes are independent of the under-relaxation factor. Finally, the proposed method of time consistent FSI on collocated grids for incompressible flows is demonstrated by applying it to a three-dimensional flow over an elastic structure in a channel and the cylinder flap FSI benchmark case of Turek and Hron.},

abstract = {The effect of gas expansion on the velocity of a Taylor bubble was studied experimentally. The velocity field in the liquid ahead of a Taylor bubble was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV), and the bubble velocity was measured with two pairs of laser diodes and photocells. The experiments were done in a 7.0 m long vertical tube with a 32 mm internal diameter. Solutions of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) polymer with weight percentages between 0.01{\%} and 0.1{\%} were used. The expansion of slug gas induces an increase in the bubble velocity and a corresponding displacement of the liquid ahead of the bubble. The velocity of the bubble increases by an amount equal to the maximum velocity in the liquid displaced. For the solutions studied, the induced velocity profile was parabolic and the bubble velocity increase was equal to the liquid velocity at the tube axis, i.e., twice the mean velocity in the liquid displaced. The corrected velocity obtained by subtracting the velocity increase from the value of the bubble velocity is independent of the bubble length. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A drift-flux model, evaluated for the local conditions in the riser, is used as a closure law. The developed model predicts the location of the liquid accumulation front in the pipeline and the liquid level in the riser, so it is possible to determine which type of severe slugging occurs in the system.

abstract = {Long liquid slugs, with sizes reaching 500 pipe diameters or more, may form in gas-liquid horizontal pipe flow at intermediate liquid loadings. Such slugs cause serious operational upsets due to the strong fluctuations in flow supply and pressure. Therefore, predicting the transition from short (hydrodynamic) to long slug flow regimes may play a significant role in preventing or reducing the negative effects caused by the long slugs. In this paper we introduce a growth model for calculating the average slug length in horizontal and near horizontal pipes. The model applies a volumetric balance between the front and tail of the slug in order to calculate the slug growth rate. The dynamic behaviour of the liquid at the tail is described by a linear kinematic relation between the slug downstream and the wave upstream. For the validation of the model we performed measurements in a 137 m length air-water horizontal pipe flow of an internal diameter (i.d.) of 0.052 m. The measurements provide a detailed flow map of the long slug regime and sub-regimes. Furthermore, we compared predictions by the model with available data for a range of 0.019-0.095 m i.d. pipes to investigate the effect of varying operation pressures, different inlet conditions, different fluid properties and slight inclinations. The model predicted the transitions from hydrodynamic to long slugs with satisfactory agreements, however it underpredicts the average slug length at relatively large mixture velocities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments were conducted using a horizontal 31. m long, D=10. cm internal diameter transparent pipe at atmospheric pressure. High resolution photography allowed the location of the gas-liquid interface to be measured with a high degree of accuracy at 5. Hz. Image analysis allowed individual waves to be tracked over a 14. D section of the pipe. Regular waves having similar properties such as speed, amplitude and length were seen far from the region of slug formation. However, near the transition region, where hydrodynamic slugs were formed, significant differences between wave properties were observed which resulted in wave interaction leading to a type of sub-harmonic resonance and slug formation. The formation of hydrodynamic slugs due to wave interaction differs from predictions for slug formation using long wavelength stability theory. The properties of the waves were quantified which gave detailed information on the resonance mechanism found near the transition to slugging. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The statistical distribution of slug lengths in a gas-liquid pipeline evolves along the pipe as short slugs collapse. This results from a lack of development of the liquid velocity profile at the rear of each slug that is shorter than a minimum stable length. Experiments have been conducted in a 50 mm diameter tube inclined at +5??to the horizontal to determine the rate of collapse of short slugs as a function of their length. The data covers both stagnant and turbulent flowing liquid, in both the elongated bubble and slug flow regimes. The data shows that all the turbulent flow results may be correlated by the same expression regardless of the value of the slug liquid Reynolds number. This correlation is employed within a model adapted for horizontal flow that assumes a random distribution of slug lengths at the pipe entrance and calculates the evolution of the slug length distribution along a pipe. The results of the model are compared against experimentally determined slug length distributions obtained in a 16 m long pipe. The comparison between the calculated and observed average slug length is shown to be quite good over a range of flow rates and the overall shape of the length distributions is predicted well by the model.

abstract = {The severe or terrain slugging is a periodic phenomenon due to liquid accumulation at the low points of a pipe, leading to a temporary blockage. Periodically the upstream pressure increases and generates liquid slugs, for which the instantaneous flow-rate increases to several times the nominal flow-rate. To prevent such phenomena in multiphase production pipelines, a proper design and a control strategy of process equipments are required to avoid operational problems. The TACITE compositional code is able to simulate the behaviour of transient multiphase flow in pipeline with process equipments such as controllers, valves, separators and lateral injectors which could be used to prevent severe slugging phenomena during production. The 22 km long, 16'' diameter Dunbar pipeline is designed to transport the Dunbar multiphase production to the Alwyn platform. Due to its profile, this pipe is typically subject to riser induced severe slugging for some given operating conditions corresponding to low flow-rates. The TACITE code has been used to simulate the Dunbar pipeline in the low flow-rate region where riser-induced severe slugging occurs. For the same rates, different slug control schemes have been tested and the simulation results demonstrated that some of them can control or even eliminate the severe slugging phenomenon. This illustrates that these slug control schemes can be easily investigated and tested by use of a transient simulator. Also the simulation results demonstrate that the use of a transient simulator is essential in the engineering design phase of a slug control scheme.},

In this paper an approximate linear stability analysis of this phenomenon is presented. It is found that, under the combined effect of gravity and the pressure gradient which drives the liquid flow, the relative velocity between the bubble and the liquid decreases with increasing downflow, which diminishes the stabilizing effect of convection. The decrease of the relative velocity is accompanied by a flattening of the bubble nose, which also has a destabilizing effect by strengthening the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the bubble nose.},

However, for a pipe in a hilly terrain or in an offshore pipeline-riser system, a steady state operation is often not possible, and conditions of severe or terrain slugging develop. This causes the system to operate in an undesired cyclic fashion in which alternate long liquid slugs are followed by the production of high gas flow rate. The present work deals with the condition under which steady state operation is possible. It shows theoretically that it is possible to stablize the flow by increasing the back pressure of the separator or by employing a controlled choking at the pipe exit. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {The previous chapters have displayed examples of partial differential equations in various fields of mathematical physics. Attention has been paid to the interpretation of these equations in the specific contexts they were presented. 1 In fact, we have delineated three types of field equations, namely hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The basic idea that the mathematical nature of these equations was fundamental to their physical significance has been creeping throughout. Still, the formats in which these three types were presented correspond to their canonical forms, that is, a form that one recognizes at first glance. Such is not the general case. For example, it is not obvious (to this author at least!) that the following second order equation, 2 ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − 4 ∂ 2 u ∂x∂t − 6 ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 + ∂u ∂x = 0 , is of hyperbolic type. In other words, it shares essential physical properties with the wave equation, ∂ 2 u ∂x 2 − ∂ 2 u ∂t 2 = 0 . Indeed, this is the aim of the present chapter to show that all equations of mathematical physics can be recast in these three fundamental types. By the same token, we introduce a new notion, that of a characteristic curve. A method to solve IBVPs based on characteristics will be exposed in the next chapter. The terminology used to coin the three types of PDEs borrows from geometry, as the criterion will be seen to rely on the nature of the roots of quadratic equations. We envisage in turn first of order equations, sets of first order equations, and second order equations. The use of a common terminology to class first and second order equations is challenged by the fact that a set of two first order equation may be transformed into a second},

A single time scale, multiple space scale asymptotic analysis is used to gain insight into the limit behavior of the compressible flow equations as the Mach number vanishes. Motivated by these results, multiple pressure variables (MPV) are introduced into the numerical framework. These account separately for thermodynamic effects, acoustic wave propagation and the balance of forces. Discretized analogues of the averaging and large scale differencing procedures known from multiple scales asymptotics allow accurate capturing of various physical phenomena that are operative on very different length scales. The MPV approach combines the explicit numerical computation of global compression from the boundary and the long wavelength acoustics on coarse grids with an implicit pressure or pressure correction equation that formally converges to the corresponding incompressible one when the Mach number tends to zero. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {When the Mach number tends to zero the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, under the restrictions of constant density, constant temperature and no compression from the boundary. This is a singular limit in which the pressure of the compressible equations converges at leading order to a constant thermodynamic background pressure, while a hydrodynamic pressure term appears in the incompressible equations as a Lagrangian multiplier to establish the divergence-free condition for the velocity. In this paper we consider the more general case in which variable density, variable temperature and heat transfer are present, while the Mach number is small. We discuss first the limit equations for this case, when the Mach number tends to zero. The introduction of a pressure splitting into a thermodynamic and a hydrodynamic part allows the extension of numerical methods to the zero Mach number equations in these non-standard situations. The solution of these equations is then used as the state of expansion extending the expansion about incompressible flow proposed by Hardin and Pope [J.C. Hardin, D.S. Pope, An acoustic/viscous splitting technique for computational aeroacoustics, Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 6 (1995) 323-340]. The resulting linearized equations state a mathematical model for the generation and propagation of acoustic waves in this more general low Mach number regime and may be used within a hybrid aeroacoustic approach. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The method formally discretizes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid. Operations are limited to a finite computational domain through a lattice Green's function technique. This technique obtains solutions to inhomogeneous difference equations through the discrete convolution of source terms with the fundamental solutions of the discrete operators. The differential algebraic equations describing the temporal evolution of the discrete momentum equation and incompressibility constraint are numerically solved by combining an integrating factor technique for the viscous term and a half-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the convective term. A projection method that exploits the mimetic and commutativity properties of the discrete operators is used to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises in each stage of the time integration scheme. Linear complexity, fast computation rates, and parallel scalability are achieved using recently developed fast multipole methods for difference equations. The accuracy and physical fidelity of solutions is verified through numerical simulations of vortex rings.},

For the exchange-term evaluation at the cell faces, the same Riemann solver as used for the flux evaluation is exploited.

abstract = {Minimum-dissipation eddy-viscosity models are a class of sub-filter models for large-eddy simulation that give the minimum eddy dissipation required to dissipate the energy of sub-filter scales. A previously derived minimum-dissipation model is the QR model. This model is based on the invariants of the resolved rate-of-strain tensor and has many desirable properties. It appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flows, has low computational complexity, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on isotropic grids. However, the QR model proposed in the literature gives insufficient eddy dissipation. It is demonstrated that this can be corrected by increasing the model constant. The corrected QR model gives good results in simu- lations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid. On anisotropic grids the QR model is not consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor and requires an approximation of the filter width. It is demonstrated that the results of the QR model on anisotropic grids are primarily determined by the used filter width approximation, and that no approximation gives satisfactory results in simulations of both a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. A new minimum-dissipation model for anisotropic grids is proposed. This anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model generalizes the desirable practical and theoretical properties of the QR model to anisotropic grids and does not require an approximation of the filter width. TheAMDmodel is success- fully applied in simulations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid and in simulations of a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow on anisotropic grids.},

abstract = {For the confirmatory factor model a series of inequalities is given with respect to the mean square error (MSE) of three main factor score predictors. The eigenvalues of these MSE matrices are a monotonic function of the eigenvalues of the matrix “ p = ¦ 1/2 › p [variant prime] ¨ p -1 › p ¦ 1/2 . This matrix increases with the number of observable variables p . A necessary and sufficient condition for mean square convergence of predictors is divergence of the smallest eigenvalue of “ p or, equivalently, divergence of signal-to-noise (Schneeweiss {\&} Mathes, 1995). The same condition is necessary and sufficient for convergence to zero of the positive definite MSE differences of factor predictors, convergence to zero of the distance between factor predictors, and convergence to the unit value of the relative efficiencies of predictors. Various illustrations and examples of the convergence are given as well as explicit recommendations on the problem of choosing between the three main factor score predictors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in some basic investigations of properties of the relaxation schemes first introduced by Jin and Xin [1]. The main advantages of these schemes are that they neither require the use of Riemann solvers nor the computation of nonlinear flux Jacobians. This can be an important advantage when more complex models are considered where it is not possible to perform analytical calculations of Jacobians and/or when considering fluids with nonstandard equation of state. We apply the schemes (relaxing and relaxed) to a certain two-phase model where Jacobians cannot in general be calculated analytically. We first demonstrate that the original relaxation schemes of Jin and Xin produce a poor approximation for a typical mass transport example which involves transition from two-phase flow to single-phase flow. However, by introducing a slight modification of the original relaxation model by splitting the momentum flux into a mass and pressure part, we obtain some flux splitting relaxation schemes which for typical two-phase flow cases yield a more accurate and robust approximation.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamic analysis and simulation of long pig through the two-dimensional gas pipelines. In the modeling, the pig's length is noticed. The long pig is considered as a chain body not a particle. Pig is divided into a number of elements, Newton's second law is written for all the different elements of pig and then all the equations are added to get the dynamic equation of the pig's motion. An algorithm is used to solve the differential equation of the motion based on Runge-Kutta method. Continuity, momentum and the state equations are employed to achieve the gas flow parameters like density, velocity and pressure along the pipeline since the dynamic behavior of the pig depends on the flow field characteristics. It is assumed that pig is long and there is a bypass valve in pig's body. The path of the pig or geometry of the pipeline is considered as 2D curve. Numerical examples are chosen to show the application of the proposed formulation and algorithm. The simulation results illustrate the validity and efficiency of the derived equations for online estimating of the position and velocity of the long pig in gas pipelines at any time of the motion.},

A series of two experimental investigations were carried out on a 6m vertical pipe with a 0.067m internal diameter charged with an air–silicone oil mixture. For the first set of experiments, the riser was initially full of air, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) and wire mesh sensor (WMS) transducers were employed. In the second one, the riser was initially full of (static) liquid, and then liquid and gas flows set to liquid and gas superficial velocities=0.05 and 0.344m/s, respectively, only ECT was used. A characterisation of the observed slug flow regimes was carried out. This includes the evaluation of the instantaneous distribution of the phases over the pipe cross-section, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of void fraction, time series of cross-sectional void fraction, Power Spectral Density (PSD), structure velocity of the Taylor bubble, lengths of the liquid slug and Taylor bubble and void fractions in the liquid slug and Taylor bubble. The simulation results were validated both qualitatively and quantitatively against experimental data. A reasonably good agreement was observed between the results of the experiment and CFD.},

@book{Gustafsson1996,
abstract = {Time dependent problems frequently pose challenges in areas of science and engineering dealing with numerical analysis, scientific computation, mathematical models, and most importantly--numerical experiments intended to analyze physical behavior and test design. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods addresses these various industrial considerations in a pragmatic and detailed manner, giving special attention to time dependent problems in its coverage of the derivation and analysis of numerical methods for computational approximations to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The book is written in two parts. Part I discusses problems with periodic solutions; Part II proceeds to discuss initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations and numerical methods for them. The problems with periodic solutions have been chosen because they allow the application of Fourier analysis without the complication that arises from the infinite domain for the corresponding Cauchy problem. Furthermore, the analysis of periodic problems provides necessary conditions when constructing methods for initial boundary value problems. Much of the material included in Part II appears for the first time in this book. The authors draw on their own interests and combined extensive experience in applied mathematics and computer science to bring about this practical and useful guide. They provide complete discussions of the pertinent theorems and back them up with examples and illustrations. For physical scientists, engineers, or anyone who uses numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena, this invaluable guide is destined to become a constant companion. Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations. What Every Physical Scientist and Engineer Needs to Know About Time Dependent Problems . . . Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods covers the analysis of numerical methods for computing approximate solutions to partial differential equations for time dependent problems. This original book includes for the first time a concrete discussion of initial boundary value problems for partial differential equations. The authors have redone many of these results especially for this volume, including theorems, examples, and over one hundred illustrations. The book takes some less-than-obvious approaches to developing its material: * Treats differential equations and numerical methods with a parallel development, thus achieving a more useful analysis of numerical methods * Covers hyperbolic equations in particularly great detail * Emphasizes error bounds and estimates, as well as the sufficient results needed to justify the methods used for applications Time Dependent Problems and Difference Methods is written for physical scientists and engineers who use numerical experiments to test designs or to predict and investigate physical phenomena. It is also extremely useful to numerical analysts, mathematical modelers, and graduate students of applied mathematics and scientific computations.},

abstract = {For fully-developed two-phase flows, maps that correlate experimental and semi-empirical expressions for flow regimes are widely used. For calculations of the various important two-phase flow parameters, this in turn requires correlations for various interfacial and wall interaction effects that are flow regime dependent. For many systems of practical interest, however, the evolution of flow regimes (such as slug flow in oil-gas pipelines) is of interest because the development lengths are long and flow regimes may change in regions where pipeline inclination changes due to the terrain. It is shown here that for slow transients in near-horizontal pipes, the one-dimensional multi-field model, when solved with sufficient resolution, does not require flow regimes to be specified or flow regime dependent closure relationships. The formulation predicts the development of flow regimes and various flow parameters without the need for maps, or the need to change closure relationships. To accomplish this, the model includes four fields, i.e. continuous and dispersed liquid, continuous and dispersed gas, as well as a set of appropriate closure relationships from the literature. For the main application considered here, i.e. slow transients in oil-gas pipelines, order of magnitude analyses indicate that certain inertial terms in the model are very small and can be neglected in comparison to the others. Advantage is taken of this to simplify both the structure of the mathematical problem and the solution procedure, which is sufficiently accurate that mass is conserved for each of the four fields. Furthermore, the calculations require high spatial resolution, so a fast, easily-parallelizable numerical procedure has been applied. The results indicate that the development of certain flow regimes, including transitions from bubbly to stratified flow and vice versa, slug flow including slug frequency and length, and the evolution of these parameters along a pipeline are well predicted by the model when compared to experimental data. As part of the validation it is also shown that the model predicts, without need to change closure relationships, flow regimes in fully-developed near-horizontal two-phase flows in good agreement with existing flow regime maps. This suggests that for slow transients in flows for which one-dimensional effects dominate, predictions can be made without requirements for flow regime maps and closure relationships that depend on them. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Waltrich2015,
abstract = {An experimental study was carried out to investigate the liquid distribution and transport in vertical gas-liquid flows in a 42. m long, 0.048. m ID tube system. Liquid loading in gas wells is generally defined as the inability of the produced gas to lift the co-produced liquid up the tubing, resulting in liquid accumulation in the wellbore. The characterization of the liquid loading phenomenon is often based on field monitoring, with limited measurements of pressure and liquid holdup profiles, and usually without visual observations of the phenomenon. The experimental observations obtained in this work show the liquid re-distribution during changes in gas flow rate. These observations revealed that, after a change in gas rate, the liquid film starts to flow downwards in the pipe, and subsequently, the liquid begins to steadily flow upward at a constant velocity. The experimental data were compared with a numerical model, showing an agreement of ??25{\%}. A pseudo-steady state approach was used to model the vertical gas-liquid flows in this long pipe to describe liquid loading in vertical wellbores. The liquid droplets entrained in the gas core were observed and estimated to be flowing upwards in order to obtain a good agreement between experimental observations and model results, even though the gas velocities were lower than Turner critical velocities. The widely accepted droplet model of Turner says that below the critical velocity, the liquid droplets should be flowing downward and not upwards.},

abstract = {Periodic pigging of oil and gas pipelines for dewatering, cleaning and inspecting is a standard industry procedure. Predicting the motion of a pig to estimate its velocity, position and required driving pressure is essential before pigging. To enhance these predictions, the frictional force between pig and pipeline is a key determinant and insufficient understanding of the frictional force characteristics leads to significant inaccuracies. As the frictional force acting parallel to the pipeline wall plane is a function of contact force in the radial direction, a 2D axisymmetric nonlinear finite element model was proposed to predict the contact force experienced by bi-directional pig by using ANSYS. The impacts of four parameters (including interference, thickness, chamfer dimension and clamping rate of the sealing discs) on the contact force and the deflection angle of the sealing disc are studied at different differential pressures over the pig. Results obtained in this study shows that the thickness of the sealing disc has the greatest impact on contact force of the bi-directional pig, followed by the chamfer dimension, then the clamping rate and finally the interference. A linear relationship between the contact force and the differential pressure can also be observed from the results. Research findings on the characteristic of contact force and deflection angle of sealing disc may provide useful information for the formulation of theoretical or mathematical models to predict the frictional force on the pig, and pigging risks may be efficiently reduced by establish mitigating strategies on the basis of prediction.},

To address this issue a fully explicit second order finite volume solver based on flux corrected transport (FCT) is implemented. The choice of variables used for limiting the fluxes affects the amount of numerical diffusion and an appropriate choice of the gradient in volume fraction is used. Practical test cases while drilling in the oil and gas industry, of gas injection inside a well annulus and shut-in of the vertical well are presented. The results conclude that the FCT solver is better and efficient for accurately capturing gas migration for multi-phase models with phase behaviour involving slip velocities given by algebraic relations.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in designing efficient methods for the solution of ordinary/ partial differential equations with random inputs. To this end, stochastic Galerkin methods appear to be superior to other nonsampling methods and, in many cases, to several sampling methods. However, when the governing equations take complicated forms, numerical implementations of stochastic Galerkin methods can become nontrivial and care is needed to design robust and efficient solvers for the resulting equations. On the other hand, the traditional sampling methods, e. g., Monte Carlo methods, are straightforward to implement, but they do not offer convergence as fast as stochastic Galerkin methods. In this paper, a high-order stochastic collocation approach is proposed. Similar to stochastic Galerkin methods, the collocation methods take advantage of an assumption of smoothness of the solution in random space to achieve fast convergence. However, the numerical implementation of stochastic collocation is trivial, as it requires only repetitive runs of an existing deterministic solver, similar to Monte Carlo methods. The computational cost of the collocation methods depends on the choice of the collocation points, and we present several feasible constructions. One particular choice, based on sparse grids, depends weakly on the dimensionality of the random space and is more suitable for highly accurate computations of practical applications with large dimensional random inputs. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the stochastic collocation methods.},

abstract = {Abstract Over the past five years, ConocoPhillips, TOTAL, and SINTEF have developed a novel transient multiphase flow simulator, called LedaFlow, with both one- and multi-dimensional capabilities. The aim of the development is to meet industry needs for improved simulation of fluids management and related flow assurance issues in oil/gas production and processing operations.{\'{y}}LedaFlow is composed of a suite of models, including a complete one-dimensional transient model with compositional tracking, a complex network solver, and algorithms to couple models of different dimensions.{\'{y}}The transient multi-dimensional model offers detailed flow distributions that are impossible to obtain with one-dimensional models.{\'{y}}It was demonstrated recently{\'{y}}that flow regime transitions, observed pressure gradients and liquid holdup can be accurately reproduced (Laux et al., 2007). In the present paper, we analyze 2-phase flows in vertical risers and demonstrate the capabilities of multi-dimensional modeling.{\'{y}} The prediction of vertical flows are very good except for low flow rates.{\'{y}} We demonstrate that complex flow regimes (such as churn flow) are predicted with the LedaFlow quasi three dimensional (Q3D) model, without resorting to assumptions about flow regimes and structures.{\'{y}} Q3D simulations show that small deviations from perfectly vertical flow may have a large effect on liquid hold-up and pressure drop.{\'{y}} The Q3D model is furthermore applied to simulate an operational situation where fluids are displaced to prevent hydrate formation during shut-down. Introduction Using the LedaFlow quasi three-dimensional (Q3D) model it is possible to predict complex flow regimes{\'{y}}such as{\'{y}}gravity-induced and hydrodynamic slugging, as well as transitional flow{\'{y}}(between wavy stratified and slug flow) in pipelines (Laux et al. 2008).{\'{y}}Prediction results for wavy stratified flow is presented in Laux et al. (2007). In this paper, we address churn flow in vertical and deviated risers as well as fluid displacement to prevent hydrate formation during a shut-down situation.{\'{y}}For multiphase flow in risers and wells, flow regimes are often very complex and can not be treated satisfactorily with 1D models.{\'{y}} One-dimensional (1D) models have been developed over the last 50 years to predict multiphase flows in pipelines. These models have been successful in assisting the industrial development but still have significant shortcomings due to simplifications and the use of empirical correlations. At the same time, new three-dimensional (3D) modeling techniques are developing fast, made possible by the continuous growth in available computational power.{\'{y}}3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models can give information that both qualitatively and even quantitatively surpasses information obtained from 1D models.},

abstract = {A new turbulence modelling approach (Very-Large Eddy Simulation; V-LES) is developed and compared to conventional RANS and LES for a flow across a tube bundle. The method, which belongs to the large-scale simulation category, represents a good compromise between efficiency and precision, and may thus be used for industrial problems for which LES remains computationally expensive under high to very-high Reynolds number flow conditions. It can also be used for gas-liquid two-phase flows such as pressurized thermal shocks. The method is a sort of blend between U-RANS and LES, in that it resolves very large structures - way larger than the grid size - and models all subscale of turbulence using a two-equation model, by reference to RANS. The original model is shown here to share the same characteristics as the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach, in that when the filter width is smaller than the wall-distance at which viscous effects are negligible (f?? = 1), the fixed filter width is replaced by the wall distance. First conclusions to be drawn from its extension here is that the flow must be resolved in three-dimensions, under transient conditions, with refined grids. Sensitivity to various computational parameters has been addressed: grid, filter width, domain size, and inflow conditions. This modelling strategy is proved to provide the flow unsteadiness in three-dimensions, while saving computational cost compared to LES. The method is computationally efficient (it can be applied using an implicit solver which permits a higher CFL than with LES; typically 1 versus 0.1), and numerically robust. The computational cost decreases with increasing filter width, though at the expenses of the quality of the results. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present an Asymptotic-Preserving 'all-speed' scheme for the simulation of compressible flows valid at all Mach-numbers ranging from very small to order unity. The scheme is based on a semi-implicit discretization which treats the acoustic part implicitly and the convective and diffusive parts explicitly. This discretization, which is the key to the Asymptotic-Preserving property, provides a consistent approximation of both the hyperbolic compressible regime and the elliptic incompressible regime. The divergence-free condition on the velocity in the incompressible regime is respected, and an the pressure is computed via an elliptic equation resulting from a suitable combination of the momentum and energy equations. The implicit treatment of the acoustic part allows the time-step to be independent of the Mach number. The scheme is conservative and applies to steady or unsteady flows and to general equations of state. One and two-dimensional numerical results provide a validation of the Asymptotic-Preserving 'all-speed' properties. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents test cases, methodologies, and test results from the extensive testing and qualification program that have been conducted with LedaFlow{\textregistered}. This new transient multiphase flowline simulator has been built with focus on multiphase flow challenges in the oil and gas industry, and the resulting software includes both transient 1D and quasi 3D multiphase models. Development has been based both on existing and new large-scale experimental data from the SINTEF multiphase laboratory, taken over a nearly ten-year period. The focus of this paper is the transient 1D model. The transient three-phase 1D simulator offers new modeling capabilities as it is based on a model concept conserving mass for 9 fields (bubbles, droplets, and continuous fluids), using three momentum equations, and solving for the enthalpy and temperature of the three individual fluid zones. Improved closure relations have been built from a combination of new large-scale multiphase flow experiments and sub-models which represents the distribution of droplets over the pipe cross section. Before introduction of this new tool to the industry, it was taken through an extensive testing and qualification program. The testing included comparison with experimental data (over 10,000 experimental points) and field data (over a dozen pipelines and wells, from wet-gas to oil), as well as comparisons to other commercially available software. Another part of the testing was focused on typical flow assurance user cases; transient simulations such as turn-down, shut-down, start-up and depressurization were run for a number of realistic field geometries. The new multiphase flow simulator reproduces experimental data and field data within defined acceptance criteria. This new multiphase flow software can be used as an alternative to other commercially available software and as a valuable new tool for flow assurance work for field development, operational studies and decision support. Introduction The development of the new transient multiphase flow simulator, with both one- and multi-dimensional capabilities has been ongoing for almost a decade. The goal of the development has been to meet industry needs for improved and alternative simulation of fluids management and related flow assurance issues in oil/gas production and processing operations. LedaFlow{\textregistered} is composed of a suite of models, including a complete one-dimensional transient model with compositional tracking and network solver. Figure 1 illustrates the three main phases of the development project and focus areas in each phase. The first phase of the project was primarily focused on extensive testing at the SINTEF Multiphase Flow Laboratory. The extensive test campaign was conducted in a 12-inch loop for 2-phase flow, and an 8-inch loop for 3-phase flow (Danielson et al, 2005). New 1D data was acquired for hold-up, pressure gradient, and flow regime. These data are exclusive available for development of the new multiphase simulator and filled data gaps in the existing SINTEF Tilda database, which now in total includes more than 10,000 data points.},

abstract = {The concurrent flow of oil and water in pipelines is a common occurrence in offshore oil production systems. The internal structure of the oil-water flow, known as the flow pattern, and the distribution of water have a great influence on the design of the pipeline. However, due to the complex nature of oil-water flows, predicting flow patterns under different operating conditions is a challenging task. The present study is an attempt toward using a computational fluid dynamics model for predicting the flow patterns under different working conditions. To this end, an Eulerian-Eulerian model along with appropriate closure laws was employed to model two-phase oil-water flows through a horizontal pipe. The standard k-epsilon model was adopted to account for the turbulence effects. Furthermore, a brief description of the main interfacial forces namely the drag, lift, and turbulent dispersion forces has been presented. The numerical model was used to predict the flow patterns under different operating conditions ranging from low to high velocities and water cuts, respectively. A comparison among the obtained numerical results and published experimental data showed reasonable agreement.},

abstract = {The dam-break solution, a known centered simple-wave when resistance is neglected, is studied with the Chezy resistance formula added to the nonlinear shallow-water equations. Resistance transforms the wavefront from a characteristic curve into an envelope of characteristics. The flow near the tip differs from the other parts, due to a distinct boundary-layer type of region adjacent to the wavefront envelope. Then a perturbation leads to a system of partial differential equations with variable coefficients. Initial conditions are derived for the singularity at the origin. By studying its characteristic equations, this system is solved explicitly for the correction functions. Except at the tip, resistance raises the water surface and lowers velocities. These functions, no longer simple-waves, possess concurrent straight characteristic lines that map into another set of the same type. The critical flow locus moves downstream, faster for more resistance, and discharge rates are reduced. The method fails in the tip layer because the asymptotic expansions for the first derivatives lose validity there. Estimates are made indirectly for the wavefront velocity by observing where the boundary-layer effect becomes predominant.},

abstract = {The velocity divergence (rate of fluid volumetric expansion) is a flow field quantity of fundamental importance in low-Mach flows. It directly affects the local mass density and therefore the local temperature through the equation of state. In this paper, starting from the conservative form of the sensible enthalpy transport equation, we derive a discrete divergence constraint for use in large-eddy simulation (LES) of low-Mach flows. The result accounts for numerical transport of mass and energy, which is difficult to eliminate in relatively coarse, engineering LES calculations when total variation diminishing (TVD) scalar transport schemes are employed. Without the correction terms derived here, unresolved (numerical) mixing of gas species with different heat capacities or molecular weights may lead to erroneous mixture temperatures and ultimately to an imbalance in the energy budget. The new formulation is implemented in a publicly available LES code called the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Accuracy of the flow solver for transport is demonstrated using the method of manufactured solutions. The conservation properties of the present scheme are demonstrated on two simple energy budget test cases, one involving a small fire in a compartment with natural ventilation and another involving mixing of two gases with different thermal properties. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Transient response due to gust loads can lead to structural failure despite the fact that the aero-elastic system is asymptotically stable. Unsteady aeroelastic analysis should therefore be included in the load calculation cycle of the aircraft design process. Especially in the transonic regime, partitioned strong coupling algorithms perform better than loose coupling algorithms and allow larger time-steps in the unsteady simulation. However, the simulation of high fidelity unsteady fluid-structure interaction using strong coupling algorithms is currently too expensive in order to be useful in industry.To accelerate high fidelity partitioned fluid-structure interaction simulations we apply space-mapping, which is a technique that originates from the field of multi-fidelity optimization. Without loss of generality we assume the availability of a cheap low fidelity fluid solver and an expensive high fidelity fluid solver. The space-mapping approach is used to accelerate the high fidelity computation using black-box input/output information of both the high fidelity fluid solver and low fidelity fluid solver. In order to achieve this, a space-mapping function is defined on the fluid-structure interface which keeps track of the differences between the high fidelity model and the low fidelity model during the coupling iterations. Reformulating the root-finding problem on the fluid-structure interaction interface using the space-mapping function results in the Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm.The Aggressive Space-Mapping algorithm is applied to 1-D and 2-D test cases in order to assess the speedup with respect to the Quasi-Newton Inverse Least Squares algorithm. The latter is considered to be the current state of the art in partitioned strong coupling algorithms. The observed speedup depends mainly on the type of FSI problem and the time step size. The maximum observed speedup is about 1.5.The application of the space-mapping technique to partitioned fluid-structure interaction problems is found to be a promising approach. The framework is non-intrusive and allows the reuse of existing solvers which is especially useful in an industrial environment. It is expected that the space-mapping technique can be combined with higher order time integration schemes that maintain accuracy over a large range of time step sizes.},

The chosen benchmark case is a wind tunnel measurement, where stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry was employed to obtain the velocity field and turbulence statistics in the near wake of a two-bladed wind turbine model and of a porous disc, which mimics the numerical actuator used in the simulations. Researchers have been invited to simulate the experimental case based on the disc drag coefficient and the inflow characteristics. Four large eddy simulation (LES) codes from different institutions and a vortex model are part of the comparison. The purpose of this benchmark is to validate the numerical predictions of the flow field statistics in the near wake of an actuator disc, a case that is highly relevant for full wind farm applications. The comparison has shown that, despite its extreme simplicity, the vortex model is capable of reproducing the wake expansion and the centreline velocity with very high accuracy. Also all tested LES models are able to predict the velocity deficit in the very near wake well, contrary to what was expected from previous literature. However, the resolved velocity fluctuations in the LES are below the experimentally measured values.},

The asymptotically preserving attribute makes the new method applicable to compressible and incompressible flows, including stiff materials, which enables large time steps characteristic of incompressible flow algorithms rather than the small time steps required by explicit methods. Shocks are captured and material discontinuities are tracked, without the aid of any approximate or exact Riemann solvers. The new method enables one to simulate the flow of multiple materials, each possessing a potentially exotic equation of state. Simulations of multiphase flow in one and two dimensions are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm at efficiently computing multiphase flows containing shock waves and material discontinuities with large “impedance mismatch.” Additionally, new techniques related to the Moment-of-Fluid interface reconstruction are presented, including a novel, asymptotically-preserving method for capturing “filaments,” and an improved method for initializing the Moment-of-Fluid optimization problem on unstructured, triangular grids.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is to explore a compressible gas-liquid model designed for modeling of well flow processes. We build into the model well-reservoir interaction by allowing flow of gas between well and formation (surrounding reservoir). Inflow of gas and subsequent expansion of gas as it ascends towards the top of the well (a so-called gas kick) represents a major concern for various well operations in the context of petroleum engineering. We obtain a global existence result under suitable assumptions on the regularity of initial data and the rate function that controls the flow of gas between well and formation. Uniqueness is also obtained by imposing more regularity on the initial data. The key estimates are to obtain appropriate lower and upper bounds on the gas and liquid masses. For that purpose we introduce a transformed version of the original model that is highly convenient for analysis of the original model. In particular, in the analysis of the transformed model additional terms, representing well-formation interaction, can be treated by natural extensions of arguments that previously have been employed for the single-phase Navier-Stokes model. The analysis ensures that transition to single-phase regions do not appear when the initial state is a true gas-liquid mixture. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A new parallel, computationally efficient immersed boundary method for solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains is presented. Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta function approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike Peskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are used to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are solved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function techniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural free-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive grid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting operations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the immersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical discrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with specialized half-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently solve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum equation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems of equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved using an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic properties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to simple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are compatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference equations. Numerical experiments on low-aspect-ratio flat plates and spheres at Reynolds numbers up to 3,700 are used to verify the accuracy and physical fidelity of the formulation.},

Cleanup of contaminated sites is very difficult, if at all possible, and estimated costs amount to hundreds of billions ofDMin Germany. Underground waste repositories currently being planned inmany countries have to be designed in such a way that groundwater quality is not harmed. In all these problems numerical simulation can help to gain a better process understanding, to make predictive studies and to ultimately optimize remedia- tion techniques with respect to cost and efficiency. Clearly, this is a long term goal and considerable progress is necessary in all aspects of the modeling pro- cess. The present work is a contribution to the fast numerical solution of the partial differential equations (PDE) governing multiphase flow in porous me- dia. A fully–coupled Newton–multigrid procedure has been implemented on the basis of the general purpose PDE software UG which allows the treatment of large–scale problems with millions of unknowns in three space dimensions on contemporary parallel computer architectures. I am very grateful to G. Wittum for continuously encouraging this (and pre- vious) work. His unlimited support of UG and the productive atmosphere at ICA III provided the basis of this work. R.

abstract = {Linear stability of horizontal gas-liquid stratified flow was solved using a tau spectral method that is valid for all wavenumbers. Pressures of 0.1-10 atm and liquid viscosities of 1-600 cP were examined. Comparison of these results with Kelvin-Helmholtz, integral momentum and rigorous long wave expansion approaches indicates that the approximate models do not correctly predict the point of neutral stability. The discrepancies in the models are due to more than differences in the calculation of interfacial perturbation stress components and differences in the base states. Stability predictions that include gas phase turbulence, as modeled with either a polynomial velocity profile or with imposed boundary conditions obtained from measured pressure and shear stress variations, are similar to laminar results if the interfacial stress and liquid depth are the same. The long wave stability boundary is found to correlate well for different channel height, density ratio and viscosity ratio, using a gas superficial Froude number corrected with a square root of density ratio and a liquid superficial Froude number. For gas-liquid channel flow waves that grow fastest typically have dimensionless wavenumbers of order unity. Their growth rate scales as a corrected gas Reynolds number to the first power. If the gas-liquid depth ratio is less than approximately one, long waves can be unstable before moderate wavelength waves. Under conditions where unstable moderate wavelength waves appear within a couple of meters, it can take 20-50 times this length for slowly growing long wavelength waves, which can destroy regime stability, to appear. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Summary A numerical fully implicit nonisothermal wellbore/reservoir simulator is developed. The model entails simultaneous solution of transient coupled mass-, momentum-, and energy-balance equations within the wellbore; energy-balance equations for the tubular and cement materials and the formation surrounding the wellbore; and mass-balance and flow-rate/pressure equations for the reservoir formation. A wellbore heat-loss model that is a strong feature of this study is developed and employed in the model to improve the accuracy of the simulator and to be able to estimate the casing temperature and formation-temperature distribution. The model formulation is completed with an equation of state (EOS) to estimate fluid properties and appropriate friction-factor correlations in the wellbore tubing to compute the frictional pressure drop for different flow regimes. The developed model has several applications in the petroleum industry, particularly in the gas-well testing design and interpretation of both isothermal and nonisothermal gas reservoirs. This nonisothermal simulator is validated through comparisons to both analytical models and an equivalent numerical isothermal coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator that is also developed in this paper. Applications of this simulator to analyzing gas-well testing problems, in addition to several important observations, are extensively studied in Part 2 of this research work (Bahonar et al. 2010). Currently, it has been well accepted that the applicability and significance of a reservoir simulator depend on the behaviour of the wellbore and interaction between the wellbore and reservoir. A robust, accurate coupled wellbore and reservoir simulator is an invaluable tool for the petroleum engineer to help the petroleum industry understand production behaviour, make a meaningful prediction, and make correct decisions in all field-development and production stages.},

The mass and momentum conservation equations of slug and annular flows were obtained. Then the evaluation criterion of flow pattern transitions were established, including dispersed flow to slug flow, bubble flow to slug flow and slug flow to annular flow. The model prediction results were compared under the experimental conditions from the previous literatures. The predictions of flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient were compared between the new model and the pipe flow model modified by using the hydraulic diameter. The results show that the flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient can be predicted by the new model more accurately, and the prediction of liquid holdup and pressure gradient are better. ?? 2014 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration {\&} Development, PetroChina.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect of small downward inclinations on the formation of slugs. Experiments were conducted with air and water at atmospheric pressure, in a pipe with a diameter of 0.0763 m, a length of 23 m and inclinations of -0.2, -0.5 and -0.8. Measurements of the variation of the interfacial displacement were made simultaneously at a number of locations. For low gas velocities in a horizontal configuration waves with lengths of 16-20 cm, grow until they reach of the top of the pipe. These waves evolve from smaller wavelength waves (8-10 cm) through a non-linear growth mechanism. At high gas velocities, the liquid height is not large enough for this mechanism to be operable. In these cases slugs evolve from the coalescence of roll waves. Surprisingly, the large amplitude small wavelength waves observed in horizontal flows, at the transition to slug flow, are damped in pipelines that are inclined slightly downward. The transition is associated with the initiation of long wavelength, small amplitude waves, whose appearance is predicted by a viscous long wavelength linear stability analysis. A local Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the crest of a growing long wavelength wave is observed when a slug forms. The frequency of slugging is equal to frequency of these long wavelength waves.

By appealing to the difference between slowly and rapidly varying quantities, it is shown that the natural closure of these terms leads to the use of a single, slowly-varying combined average flux, common to both phases, plus rapidly-varying local contributions for each phase. The result is general and only rests on the hypothesis that the spatial variation of the combined average flux is adequately described by a linear function of position within the averaging volume. No further hypotheses on the nature of the flow (e.g., about specific flow regimes) prove necessary. The result agrees with earlier ones obtained by ensemble averaging, is illustrated with the example of disperse flows and discussed in the light of some earlier and current literature.

abstract = {We consider the motion of a deformable interface that separates a fully-developed tur- bulent gas flow from a thin layer of laminar liquid.We outline a linear model to describe the interaction between the turbulent gas flow and the interfacial waves. This approach includes two steps. First, we derive a flat-interface base state. This comprises a velocity profile that takes account of the laminar sublayer present in the near-interfacial region of the gas, and a method for determining the wall and interfacial shear stresses as a function of the mean pressure gradient. The second step involves an Orr–Sommerfeld analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and necessitates the selection of a turbulent-stress closure scheme. This approach permits us to determine numeri- cally the growth rate of the wave amplitude, as a function of the relevant dimensionless system parameters and turbulence closure relations. It also extends previous work by accounting for the effects of the thin liquid layer on the dynamics. The inclusion of this feature has a startling effect: by a judicious choice of viscosity or density contrast, or of surface-roughness parameter, we observe mode competition, in which the maximum growth rate of the instability derives its energy from internal effects in the liquid layer, rather than from interfacial effects. We have also classified the observed waves either as ‘fast' or ‘slow', and compared our results with experimental data: excellent agreement is obtained in the slow-wave case, while only qualitative agreement is obtained for faster waves. This is consistent with our demonstration that the stationary turbulence model used is valid only for slow waves.},

Drag reduction was achieved by adding 40. ppm of polymer into an oil-water flow in an acrylic pipe of 0.0306. m ID flowing at 0.1-1.6. m/s mixture velocities and 0.05-0.9 input oil volume fractions. The downward inclination enhanced the mixing of the two phases and hence the boundaries between the dispersed and separated flows occurred at lower mixture velocities in downward flow than in horizontal flow. In both pipe orientations, the addition of the DRP affects the flow patterns and pressure gradients mainly in the water-dominated flow regions. Compared with those of the horizontal flow, the effect of polymer addition on flow pattern boundaries was generally lower at -5° inclination. The effect of the polymer on the pressure gradients was more pronounced at horizontal flow than at -5° flow, resulting in a maximum drag reduction of 64{\%} and 55{\%} at horizontal and -5° flows, respectively. Since the polymer used is water-soluble, there were no observable changes in the flow characteristics at the oil-dominated flow regions.},

@article{Ujang2006,
abstract = {A series of two-phase air-water experiments was carried out in order to study the initiation and the subsequent evolution of hydrodynamic slugs in a horizontal pipeline. Experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure, 4.0 bar(a) and 9.0 bar(a), and the effects of superficial liquid and gas velocities were investigated. The test section used for these experiments is 37 m in length, with an internal diameter of 0.078 m. To study the interfacial development, measurements of interfacial structures were made at 14 axial locations along the test section, with data acquired at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz. A large number of slugs were initiated within the first 3 m of the test section, with the frequency subsequently reducing towards the fully developed value before the end of the pipe. This reduction in frequency was strongly influenced by the magnitude of the gas and liquid velocities. The frequency of slugging was not strongly affected when the system pressure was changed from 1 atmosphere, to 4.0 and 9.0 bar(a), closely similar values being obtained at the 10 downstream locations. However, higher pressure delayed the onset of slug initiation, with "slug precursors" being formed further downstream as the pressure was increased. The statistical distributions of slug lengths and of the time intervals between slug arrivals were examined in detail and compared to several standard distributions. This showed that slug initiation may be reasonably approximated as an uncorrelated Poisson process with an exponential distribution of arrival times. However, once slugs have developed, there is strong correlation and the arrival time intervals, as well as the lengths, are best represented by the log-normal distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Woods2006,
abstract = {The generation of slugs was studied for air-water flow in horizontal 0.0763 m and 0.095 m pipes. The emphasis was on high liquid rates (uLS ??? 0.5 m/s) for which slugs are formed close to the entry and the time intervals between slugs are stochastic. A "fully developed" slug flow is defined as consisting of slugs with different sizes interspersed in a stratified flow with a height slightly larger than the height, h0, needed for a slug to be stable. Properties of this "fully developed" pattern are discussed. A correlation for the frequency of slugging is suggested, which describes our data as well as the data from other laboratories for a wide range of conditions. The possibility is explored that there is a further increase of slug length beyond the "fully developed" condition because slugs slowly overtake one another. The evolution of slugs from a highly disturbed stratified flow at the inlet was studied by measuring the holdup at a number of locations along a 20 m length of 0.0763 m pipe. At superficial gas velocities less than 3 m/s incipient slugs form by waves touching the top of the pipe very close to the entry. At USG {\textgreater} 3-4 m/s incipient slugs form by wave coalescence farther downstream. These incipient slugs grow as long as the height of the stratified flow in front of them is greater than h0. When equal to h0, the slug can propagate downstream or decay if it has not reached a stable length. Decaying slugs form large amplitude roll waves which propagate downstream at a lower velocity than slugs. Slugs that overtake these waves increase in size. These results can be used in developing a stochastic model for the evolution. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Results are presented for the initiation of slug-type structures from stratified 2D, two-layer pressure-driven channel flow. Good agreement is obtained with an Orr-Sommerfeld-type stability analysis for the growth rate and wave speed of very small disturbances. The numerical results elucidate the non-linear evolution of the interface shape once small disturbances have grown substantially. It is shown that relatively short waves (which are the most unstable according to linear theory) saturate when the length of the periodic domain is equally short. In longer domains, coalescence of short waves of small-amplitude is shown to lead to large-amplitude long waves, which subsequently exhibit a tendency towards slug formation. The non-uniform distribution of the interfacial shear stress is shown to be a significant mechanism for wave growth in the non-linear regime. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the physical basis of a new type of multidimensional two-fluid model, particularly suited for transient flow problems. Important constitutive relations for wall shear stress and interfacial momentum transfer with necessary assumptions and simplifications are discussed. The numerical method is based on an implicit finite difference scheme, solved directly in two steps applying a separate equation for the pressure. The model has been verified through extensive comparisons with available experimental data as well as through comparisons with other models.},

abstract = {The distribution of most chemical species in a porous environment is generally determined by both transport and biogeochemical processes. When a system in equilibrium is disturbed by the addition of species, the system reacts in a complex way to approach a new equilibrium. The time scale of that adjustment depends on the kinetics of slow reactions. Such a representation is given in many experiments or technical devices. In a natural environment, surface water penetrates into adjacent sediments and may reach pumping wells for drinking water after a subsurface passage in a porous medium. Downstream from landfills, contaminated sites, and mine tailings is particularly crucial as toxic or otherwise harmful substances contribute to the pool of chemical species. In order to obtain an understanding of the complex interaction of different processes involved, computer simulations are tools without alternative. In modeling studies, the simultaneous action of transport and biogeochemistry is to be considered. Codes, which perform such computations, are implemented following different numerical and conceptual methods, of which most important ones are outlined in the chapter Several example cases, some hypothetical, some with practical relation including carbonate chemistry are presented, discussed, and modeled in the chapter. Simulations are performed with a self-developed MATLAB module. The popular operator splitting (two-step) approach is to be handled with care. It may produce severe errors for increasing kinetic rate constants, for which the direct approach produces reliable results.},

abstract = {The possibility to estimate accurately the subsurface electric properties from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signals using inverse modeling is obstructed by the appropriateness of the forward model describing the GPR subsurface system. In this paper, we improved the recently developed approach of Lambot et al. whose success relies on a stepped-frequency continuous-wave (SFCW) radar combined with an off-ground monostatic transverse electromagnetic horn antenna. This radar configuration enables realistic and efficient forward modeling. We included in the initial model: 1) the multiple reflections occurring between the antenna and the soil surface using a positive feedback loop in the antenna block diagram and 2) the frequency dependence of the electric properties using a local linear approximation of the Debye model. The model was validated in laboratory conditions on a tank filled with a two-layered sand subject to different water contents. Results showed remarkable agreement between the measured and modeled Green's functions. Model inversion for the dielectric permittivity further demonstrated the accuracy of the method. Inversion for the electric conductivity led to less satisfactory results. However, a sensitivity analysis demonstrated the good stability properties of the inverse solution and put forward the necessity to reduce the remaining clutter by a factor 10.

Such problems arise in a variety of applications, e.g. constrained mechanical systems, fluid dynamics, chemical reaction kinetics, simulation of electrical networks, and control engineering. From a more theoretical viewpoint, the study of differential-algebraic problems gives insight into the behaviour of numerical methods for stiff ordinary differential equations. These lecture notes provide a self-contained and comprehensive treatment of the numerical solution of differential-algebraic systems using Runge-Kutta methods, and also extrapolation methods. Readers are expected to have a background in the numerical treatment of ordinary differential equations. The subject is treated in its various aspects ranging from the theory through the analysis to implementation and applications.},

@article{Tossas2013,
abstract = {With the shortage of fossil fuel and the increasing environmental awareness, wind energy is becoming more and more important. As the market for wind energy grows, wind turbines and wind farms are becoming larger. Current utility-scale turbines extend a significant distance into the atmospheric boundary layer. Therefore, the interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer and the turbines and their wakes needs to be better understood. The turbulent wakes of upstream turbines affect the flow field of the turbines behind them, decreasing the power production and increasing mechanical loading. With a better understanding of this type of flow, wind farm developers could plan better-performing, less maintenance-intensive wind farms. Simulating this flow using computational fluid dynamics is one important way to gain a better understanding of wind farm flows. In this study, we compare the performance of actuator disc and actuator line models in producing wind turbine wakes and the wake-turbine interaction between multiple turbines. We also examine parameters that affect the performance of these models, such as grid resolution, the use of a tip-loss correction, and the way in which the turbine force is projected onto the flow field.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Multiphase Flow 18, 821-830) suggested that one should distinguish between the stability of the interface due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz analysis and the stability of the steady-state solutions with respect to the average film thickness, even if the interface is unstable. This type of analysis is termed the structural stability analysis. The stability of the structure was analyzed by a simplified approach (assuming a uniform film thickness). In this work the results obtained by the structural stability analysis are verified by the use of a more exact formulation, the two-fluid model equations. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Prediction of the liquid level in stratified two-phase upwards flow shows that one may have multiple solutions. In this case it is necessary to determine which solutions will actually occur and whether hysteresis is possible, namely whether it is possible to have two or more solutions for the same operating conditions. In this work the stability of the solutions for stratified flow is considered using two types of stability analyses: (1) structural stability analysis; and (2) interfacial stability analysis (Kelvin-Helmholtz, K-H). For the K-H stability analysis we used two methods: an approximate simplified method suggested by Taitel {\&} Dukler; and a more rigorous method suggested by Barnea, which is based on a combination of the viscous K-H and inviscid K-H analyses. The results show that whenever three solutions exist only the first, i.e. the solution with the thinnest liquid level, is stable. The middle solution is always structurally unstable (linearly), whereas the third solution is structurally unstable to large disturbances (non-linear stability). The third solution is usually also unstable to the K-H type of instability. As a result it is concluded that hysteresis is not possible and that only the thinnest solution will be observed practically. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Pal2000,
abstract = {A new modified form of the equation of N. Phan-Thien and D. C. Pham (J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 72, 305 (1997)) is proposed to describe the viscosity-concentration behavior of emulsions of nearly spherical droplets. The proposed equation, as well as other existing theoretical equations, is evaluated in light of a large body of experimental data on concentrated emulsions, covering a broad range of dispersed-phase to continuous-phase viscosity ratios (4.15x10(-3) to 1.17x10(3)). In general, the experimental data exhibit large deviations from the existing theoretical equations; for example, the theoretical equation of Phan-Thien and Pham underpredicts the relative viscosity of concentrated emulsions by a large amount. The equation proposed in this work describes the experimental viscosity data of different emulsion systems remarkably well. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Transient simulation of two-phase gas-liquid flow in pipes requires considerable computational efforts. Until recently, most available commercial codes are based on the two-fluid model which includes one momentum conservation equation for each phase. However, in normal pipe flow operation, especially in oil and gas transport, the transient response of the system proves to be relatively slow. Thus is is reasonable to think that simpler forms of the transport equations might suffice to represent transient phenomena. Furthermore, these types of model smay be solved using less time-consuming numerical algorithms.},
