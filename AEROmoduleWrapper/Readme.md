# AEROmoduleWrapper
Contains MATLAB routines for computing samples of power and axial force with perturbed twist and chord. The perturbation is 
based on the Non-Uniforms Rational B-splines (NURBS).

## generateAeroModuleSamples.m
Computes the sample for power and axial force. Below is the result for 5% uncertainty in the control points of twist and chord.
