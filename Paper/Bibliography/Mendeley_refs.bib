abstract = {Optimization algorithms coupled with computational fluid dynamics are used for wind turbines airfoils design. This differs from the traditional aerospace design process since the lift-to-drag ratio is the most important parameter and the angle of attack is large. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed with the incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in steady state using a one equation turbulence model. A detailed validation of the simulations is presented and a computational domain larger than suggested in literature is shown to be necessary. Different approaches to parallelization of the computational code are addressed. Single and multiobjective genetic algorithms are employed and artificial neural networks are used as a surrogate model. The use of artificial neural networks is shown to reduce computational time by almost 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

This leads to the simultaneous optimization of the chord, twist and structural design variables, together with the airfoil shapes along the blade. As airfoils are automatically tailored to the evolution of the blade, this process results in a better exploration of the solution space and relieves the user from the burden of up-front choices, leading to better final designs.

abstract = {Vibrations of a wind turbine have a negative impact on its performance. Mitigating this undesirable impact requires knowledge of the relationship between the vibrations and other wind turbine parameters that could be potentially modified. Three approaches for ranking the impact importance of measurable turbine parameters on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower are discussed. They include the predictor importance analysis, the global sensitivity analysis, and the correlation coefficient analysis versed in data mining and statistics. To decouple the impact of wind speed on the vibrations of the drive train and the tower, the analysis is performed on data sets with narrow speed ranges. Wavelet analysis is applied to filter noisy accelerometer data. To exclude the impact malfunctions on the vibration analysis, the data are analyzed in a frequency domain. Data-mining algorithms are used to build models with turbine parameters of interest as inputs, and the vibrations of drive train and tower as outputs. The performance of each model is thoroughly evaluated based on metrics widely used in the wind industry. The neural network algorithm outperforms other classifiers and is considered to be the most promising approach to study wind turbine vibrations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 by ASME.},

abstract = {Wind turbines are designed using the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-1 standard,1 which prescribes a set of simulations to ascertain the ultimate and fatigue loads that the turbine could encounter under a variety of environmental and operational conditions. In the simulation prescription, the only probabilistic variable considered is the mean hub-height wind speed. Other wind parameters - such as the turbulence spectra, sheer, veer, spatial coherence, and component correlation - are deterministic values that remain constant across all simulations (turbulence and coherence only vary with wind speed). In addition, these values are set based on the IEC classification of the wind turbine and hub height. These other wind parameters, however, could vary vastly in time and between different sites and could potentially have a significant effect on the resulting loads the turbine could see. Therefore, this paper seeks to assess the sensitivity of different wind parameters on the resulting loads of the wind turbine, to (1) rank the sensitivities of different parameters, (2) help establish error bars around the predictions of engineering models during validation efforts, and (3) provide insight to probabilistic design methods and site-suitability analyses.},

abstract = {The effects of wind shear and turbulence on rotor fatigue and loads control are explored for a large horizontal axis wind turbine in variable speed operation at wind speeds from 4 to 20 m/s. Two- and three-blade rigid rotors are considered over a range of wind shear exponents up to 1.25 and a range of turbulence intensities up to 17{\%}. RMS blade root flatwise moments are predicted to be very substantially increased at higher wind shear, and resultant fatigue damage is increased by many orders of magnitude. Smaller but similar trends occur with increasing turbulence levels. In-plane fatigue damage is driven by 1P gravity loads and exacerbated by turbulence level at higher wind speeds. This damage is higher by one to two orders of magnitude at the roots of the three-blade rotor compared with the two-blade rotor. Individual blade pitch control of fluctuating flatwise moments markedly reduces flatwise fatigue damage due to this source, and, to a lesser degree, the in-plane damage due to turbulence. The same is true of fluctuating rotor torque moments driven by turbulence and transmitted to the drive train. Blade root moments out of the plane of rotation aggregate to create rotor pitching and yawing moments transmitted to the turbine structure through the drive train to the yaw drive system and the tower. These moments are predicted to be relatively insensitive to turbulence level and essentially proportional to the wind shear exponent for the two-blade rotor. Fluctuating moments are substantially reduced with individual blade pitch control, and addition of a teeter degree-of-freedom should further contribute to this end. Fluctuating pitching and yawing moments of the three-blade rotor are substantially less sensitive to wind shear, more sensitive to turbulence level, and substantially lower than those for the two-blade rotor. Mean rotor torque and, hence, power are essentially the same for both rotors, independent of wind shear, and are somewhat reduced with individual blade pitch control of fluctuating flatwise moments. The same is true of mean rotor thrust; however fluctuations in rotor thrust are substantially reduced with individual blade pitch control.},

The loads analysis process requires precise knowledge of the expected wind-inflow conditions as well as turbine structural and aerodynamic properties. However, uncertainty in most parameters is inevitable. It is therefore important to understand the impact such uncertainties have on the resulting loads. The goal of this work is to assess which input parameters have the greatest influence on turbine power, fatigue loads, and ultimate loads during normal turbine operation. An Elementary Effects (EE) sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most sensitive parameters. Separate case studies are performed on (1) wind-inflow conditions and (2) turbine structural and aerodynamic properties, both using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5-MW baseline wind turbine. The focus is on individual parameter sensitivity, though interactions between parameters are considered.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The results of this work show that for wind-inflow conditions, turbulence in the primary wind direction and shear are the most sensitivity parameters for turbine loads, which is expected.

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to calculate wind turbine load sensitivities to turbulence parameters through the use of response surfaces. A response surface is a highdimensional polynomial surface that can be calibrated to any set of input/output data and then used to generate synthetic data at a low computational cost. Sobol sensitivity indices (SIs) can then be calculated with relative ease using the calibrated response surface. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by calculating the total sensitivity of the maximum blade root bending moment of the WindPACT 5 MW reference model to four turbulence input parameters: a reference mean wind speed, a reference turbulence intensity, the Kaimal length scale, and a novel parameter reflecting the nonstationarity present in the inflow turbulence. The input/output data used to calibrate the response surface were generated for a previous project. The fit of the calibrated response surface is evaluated in terms of error between the model and the training data and in terms of the convergence. The Sobol SIs are calculated using the calibrated response surface, and the convergence is examined. The Sobol SIs reveal that, of the four turbulence parameters examined in this paper, the variance caused by the Kaimal length scale and nonstationarity parameter are negligible. Thus, the findings in this paper represent the first systematic evidence that stochastic wind turbine load response statistics can be modeled purely by mean wind wind speed and turbulence intensity.},

abstract = {Polynomial surrogates are used to characterize the energy production and lifetime equivalent fatigue loads for different components of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine under realistic atmospheric conditions. The variability caused by different turbulent inflow fields are captured by creating independent surrogates for the mean and standard deviation of each output with respect to the inflow realizations. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the turbulent inflow realization has a bigger impact on the total distribution of equivalent fatigue loads than the shear coefficient or yaw miss-alignment. The methodology presented extends the deterministic power and thrust coefficient curves to uncertainty models and adds new variables like damage equivalent fatigue loads in different components of the turbine. These surrogate models can then be implemented inside other work-flows such as: estimation of the uncertainty in annual energy production due to wind resource variability and/or robust wind power plant layout optimization. It can be concluded that it is possible to capture the global behavior of a modern wind turbine and its uncertainty under realistic inflow conditions using polynomial response surfaces. The surrogates are a way to obtain power and load estimation under site specific characteristics without sharing the proprietary aeroelastic design.},

The wind turbine, support structure and environmental conditions are represented by a large number of input parameters, whose uncertainties are accounted by applying partial safety factors. In this paper, the sensitivity of fatigue loads with respect to primary structural, geotechnical and metocean parameters are investigated for a 5 MW offshore wind turbine installed on a gravity based foundation. Linear regression of Monte Carlo simulations and Morris screening are performed for three design load cases. Results show that parameter significance rankings vary according to which design load case is considered. In general, uncertainties in the fatigue loads are highly influenced by turbulence intensity and wave load uncertainties, while uncertainties in soil property suggest significant nonlinear or interactive effects. This work provides insights to foundation designers and wind turbine manufacturers on which parameters must be assessed in more detail in order to reduce uncertainties in load prediction.},

abstract = {According to the wind turbine standard IEC 61400-1, structural integrity of wind turbines is determined either by direct reference to wind data or by load calculation. In both cases, deterministic values are applied and uncertainties neglected for the wind climate parameters and the structural resistance.The uncertainty related to the wind climate parameters depends highly on the presence, duration and quality of on-site wind measurements, and the perturbations introduced by flow modelling. For the wind speed distribution, the uncertainty is considered in assessment of the annual energy production. For other wind climate parameters which potentially have a large influence on the wind turbine loads, the uncertainty is often not well investigated.This paper presents a probabilistic framework for assessment of the structural reliability level of wind turbines in fatigue loading. Uncertainty of the site specific wind climate parameters at each turbine position is estimated based on the local wind measurements, speed-up factors and the distance between the wind turbine and the measuring position. The framework is demonstrated for a wind turbine project in flat terrain. The results show that the uncertainty in the site specific wind climate parameters normally accounts for 10-30{\%} of the total uncertainty in the structural reliability analyses.},

abstract = {Currently, the wind turbine size is increasing dramatically, and the blades are experiencing large deformations. Accordingly, the aerodynamic force distributions over the blades are changed, and hence aeroelastic analysis has become of great importance. The state-of-the-art simulation tools for wind turbines aeroelasticity utilize engineering models to find the aeroelastic response. These tools use simplified methods such as BEM to find the unsteady aerodynamic loads and 1D structural models to determine the deformations. They are computationally cheap, but they are based on different corrections to account for the unsteadiness and the 3D effects. These corrections might lead to a decrease in model accuracy. Therefore, the objective of the present studies is to compare the results of engineering models to CFD-based aeroelastic simulations that do require less empirical modeling. The Multi-Body Simulation (MBS) solver SIMPACK is used to determine the dynamic response of the rotor and the blade aerodynamic loads were calculated by an integrated third-party module (AeroDyn) based on BEM. The block-structured CFD solver FLOWer is utilized to obtain the aerodynamic blade loads based on the time-accurate solution of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The engineering model predicted smaller power and thrust compared to the values obtained using the high-fidelity CFD-based aeroelastic model. Moreover, 1{\%}–1.5{\%} increase in the power and thrust was predicted from the engineering model by increasing the number of polars used along the blade.},
